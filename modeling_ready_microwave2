I tested it on several known good outlets and even let it sit unplugged overnight in case it was some residual charge preventing normal operation. It Still won't power on this morning so I contacted Panasonic.<br /><br />First of all, their website runs you around in loops. I go to their support section it asks for my model number, I put it in and it just takes me to an overview shopping page. No option for support aside from a little contact us sidebar that almost seems like an afterthought to the whole sales process. I already bought your product, Panasonic. I need it repaired now under your warranty. Please stop taking me in loops.<br /><br />When looking up a repair center on their product support portal -- which is a second site that you have to ALSO register one, so you have two registrations for the same company an the same product but in order to register it and supposedly have your warranty information stored with them it's a whole second site to register the microwave on from the main one you get to the support portal one. But I registered, so the agent should be able to look up my info, right?<br /><br />Wrong. I had to give the agent I chatted with every single piece of my information despite it all being in my online support profile through their website. What's the point of offering online registration for your products if your support agents don't even have access to the information? I ended up having to login to my support profile and copy and paste every bit of info over. That's just senseless.<br /><br />So I'd tried to look up a repair center before I contacted the chat agent and it's given me one almost 9 hours away on the border of Mexico. Then the agent gave me some third party that was only about 2 hours away, but the thing is I don't have a car and I'm not driving a distance that will surely cost me more than the microwave to have it repaired even if I did. And when I asked about shipping the agent was very squirrely about answering me on it. He's claimed he'd escalated it to a supervisor and I'll hear back in 24-48 hours, but that's only lengthening the time I'm without my microwave and access to my heat therapy packs. At this point I think I'm going to have to go buy a non-Panasonic microwave to replace this one and even if it does get repaired give it to my roommate or something because I am not sure I trust it anymore.",2015-08-24,"I purchased this microwave about 3, almost 4 months ago and last night while using it to reheat a cup of tea the microwave up and quit only about 10 seconds into the reheating.

My nephew told me if you have an inverter in the microwave it makes it a bit more light weight so that is a good thing.  My last microwave was a Panasonic and lasted from 1982 to 2015.  I honestly cannot say it is not working even now but I put coconut oil in a plastic container and after a few seconds it made a loud buzz noise, the inside light got bright and there was black on the square inside where the electrical components are so I think the fat in the coconut oil may have smothered the steam and caused a problem. (My new manual says not to put fats and water in the microwave for this reason.)  Far be it from me to push my luck and start a fire till this old microwave gets checked out but I have to say it lasted a long time and I reheated my coffee almost every hour with it for many years!!

I have not yet disposed of my GE which died, but I opened and closed its door, just to make a comparison and no problem at all. Upon examination of this Panasonic, it seems that part of the problem could be that the door is not connected in a level manner on the hinges, it sags just a tad on the latch side, so that if you raise the door up a bit, by the latch edge, it then closes a little bit more easily, but still it does not close as smoothly and easily as the same model that my son has.  I am already disappointed and I have not turned it on yet!! I will update, but wonder if I should immediately return it before trying it any further, since no matter how well it functions otherwise, I will still have this door problem.  My son will be coming over today, and I will have him take a look.  I had told him about reading of door problems, but he thought people were just being fussy, since his is perfectly fine.  He loves his.  Soooo, I ordered it.  This does make one wonder about Panasonic's quality control. I just called Panasonic and spoke to someone in the Caribbean, and had to repeat my description of what was happening several times. All the young man said is that I should take it back to the store or take it to a Panasonic repair facility and have them repair it.  He could offer no other explanation, and kept asking if it worked otherwise.  I told him it was new and I did not want the inconvenience of having to find and drive to a repair shop,so he said if I bought it from Amazon I should probably call and return it to them.  Which I think I probably should do at this point.  I will however, at least try and run it to see if it is also as noisy as some people say.  My son's unit is quiet, and in every way so far just fine.  Update: 6/26..... Ok, I have been heating  my frozen deserts and my soup.  it heats my soup well enough with no problem.  However, for some reason,  I have to add extra time in order to get it to cook my frozen pineapple upside down cakes.  Since it is supposed to be so powerful, I don't understand why this is necessary.  And even after adding an additional 20 or 30 seconds, they still don't seem to be cooked as well as my cheapy old GE did with a shorter period of time, the recommended time on the package.    Supposedly, if you use the number pad the micro is supposed to use the highest power, so if this is the highest power it makes me wonder if the power settings are working properly.    I have adjusted to the difficult door, but wish it would cook my frozen deserts better.  they don't even seem really warm when I take them out.  This doesn't seem right.   and this task is one of my reasons for having a microwave! As far as the noise is concerned, I don't think it is any louder than many others, tho my GE was quieter.  I will continue to try this machine out,  and see how I feel  as i try some other tasks.  So far, it is failing on 50 % of the tasks I use a microwave for.

This doesn't seem right.   and this task is one of my reasons for having a microwave! As far as the noise is concerned, I don't think it is any louder than many others, tho my GE was quieter.  I will continue to try this machine out,  and see how I feel  as i try some other tasks.  So far, it is failing on 50 % of the tasks I use a microwave for.  I have never used one for anything complicated.  Just deserts and frozen dinners and soup. Still haven't tried a frozen dinner."

13799983,R3N9ZTUQ4CADVU,B005BFZ5ZY,4.0,2.0,2.0,Y,Good Deal,We bought this microwave over a year ago and it is still working unlike the last GE we had that lasted a mere 6 months. This is a good size microwave for two people who mainly use it for frozen meals. It is also large enough for larger dishes when cooking for the holidays or a larger group of people who want to warm up meals on a large dinner plate. We love the quick minute button!  Our only complaints are when running or warming up a meal you can't really see your plate in the microwave. The window is too dark. I never really thought about this until now when you can't see if something is splattering all over the insides. On the left side of the microwave are vents which were not on the other two microwaves. There is nothing really wrong with this fact except for the looks. Over all we are happy with it for the price and size. Waited a good year to write a  review on this for a more honest opinion on its operation as a whole.,2015-05-30,We bought this microwave over a year ago and it is still working unlike the last GE we had that lasted a mere 6 months.

I don't remember what kind it was, but I &#34;think&#34; it was a GE.  It worked very well for over 20 years.  I had moved it twice!  I have since gone through 3 other microwaves that didn't last but a few years each.  This was my most recent microwave purchase, approximately 2 years ago.  But now it has stopped working as well.  They just don't make them to last anymore.  They want you to have to replace them so they can make more money.  UGH!!!!  But, when I first bought this microwave, it was the perfect size, worked great, met all of my needs, and even looked good.  The things I didn't like it about it while it still worked were that it was LOUD while operating, and to open and close you have to push a button that can sometimes be hard to do if you hands are almost full and you don't have full strength.  Shutting the door would wake up the baby.  I wish they would make a QUIET microwave with a pull handle to open it, and maybe somehow make the closing of the door possible without a loud announcement.

I am writing this review because I happen to be shopping for yet ANOTHER microwave and thought I would share my experience.  If you only need one for a year or two, this would be perfect.",2015-04-30,"The first microwave I ever bought was from Friedman's Microwaves in Springdale Plaza back in around the late 80's.  I don't remember what kind it was, but I ""think"" it was a GE.  It worked very well for over 20 years.  I had moved it twice!  I have since gone through 3 other microwaves that didn't last but a few years each.  This was my most recent microwave purchase, approximately 2 years ago.  But now it has stopped working as well.  They just don't make them to last anymore.  They want you to have to replace them so they can make more money.  UGH!!!!  But, when I first bought this microwave, it was the perfect size, worked great, met all of my needs, and even looked good.  The things I didn't like it about it while it still worked were that it was LOUD while operating, and to open and close you have to push a button that can sometimes be hard to do if you hands are almost full and you don't have full strength.  Shutting the door would wake up the baby.  I wish they would make a QUIET microwave with a pull handle to open it, and maybe somehow make the closing of the door possible without a loud announcement.  But other than those things, it was really a great microwave while it still worked.  I am writing this review because I happen to be shopping for yet ANOTHER microwave and thought I would share my experience.  If you only need one for a year or two, this would be perfect."

Opened the door and they immediately went out.  I have used it since (with great anxiety) and have had no more issues...yet.

Other microwave ovens, if you set the power at 20%, give you 100% of the power 20% of the time.

And trust me I know stupid technology; I support Windoze machines for a living!<br /><br />First off, the interface on this thing is the most counter-intuitive interface I've ever used.<br />It's almost like they went out of their way to make using this microwave a complete PITA.<br />I must hand it to Panasonic &#34;engineers&#34; for working so diligently at making such a spectacularly awful product.<br /><br />Using this microwave apparently requires an extensive knowledge of PML (Panasonic Microwave Language), an ancient Japanese language that  only two people, kept deep in the bowels of the Panasonic underground lair, actually understand. The rest of us mere mortals must suffer through wild ignorance to use it.<br />You want to cook on any power setting, other than cremate? Be ready to push no less than 10 buttons to do so.<br />Want to check the power settings while it's running? Well you'd need to record the entire programming sequence ahead of time, because this thing won't divulge such state secrets.<br />Want to set the clock?

The rest of us mere mortals must suffer through wild ignorance to use it.You want to cook on any power setting, other than cremate? Be ready to push no less than 10 buttons to do so.Want to check the power settings while it's running?

Most of the reviews submitted by others are accurate - no light when door is open, no door handle, a bit loud, no one touch start, etc.  However, it is probably the best microwave out there and its pros significantly outweigh the few annoying cons.<br /><br />First unit:  Adequately sized to accommodate a dinner plate or large dish for steaming fresh veggies.  The automatic controls for sensor reheat and sensor cook work extremely well.  It nicely softens a half gallon of ice cream (power level 3 for 1:45).  We never really used turbo defrost.  The big negative was that we had to occasionally smack the side of the unit to get it to run, or for the inverter to kick in.  This started about three months after we owned it.  Funny, I'd smack it, get great satisfaction when it started, and then it would typically run perfectly for 3-6 months.  The unit lasted about two years before we decided to replace it.  However, my wife took it into work, where it is still functioning; just a little less reliably.<br /><br />The new unit:  The display seems brighter, and the door opens and shuts with less effort and noise (a big plus in my mind).  No other changes to the microwave controls, look, or functionality.<br /><br />I'm a gadget guy and I considered buying the premier version of this microwave, but decided to save the $65.  Most of the time we reheat dinner plates, cook veggies, or soften ice cream and butter.  Unfortunately, electronics like microwaves, coffee makers, TVs, etc. have to be considered as disposable and need to be replaced in 2-3 years.

49695718,R2LMT7BRX0W,B005BFZ5ZY,2.0,4.0,5.0,Y,Designed by somebody who's never used a microwave,"It cooks OK.  But the light doesn't turn on when you open the door.  Come on Panasonic that's like one extra wire.  There is already a switch to let the microwave know it's door is open so it won't start.  And there is already a light, connect the two.  First microwave I've ever owned where the light doesn't come on when you open the door.<br /><br />Also this microwave lacks a quick start feature.  Most of my previous microwaves had a button you could push that would instantly start cooking and put 30 seconds on the clock.  Pushing that button again would add 30 seconds.  This is pretty much the only button I ever used.  On this Panasonic you have to push the Quick button (which puts 1 minutes on the clock, which is too long sometimes) and then press start.  It's a minor thing but it annoys me every time I use it.<br /><br />The power setting on this microwave is sort of dumb too.  You have to push the power button repeatedly to set the power you want.  For instance if you want 50% power you have to push the power button 5 times.  Also you MUST do this before you start cooking or put in the time.  On my other microwaves I could change power at any time and after pressing the power button I could just press a number for the percentage of power I wanted.<br /><br />This microwave is about an inch taller then most of them.

So if you're tall and standing close you won't be able to read the screen without bending down.",2014-12-31,"It cooks OK.  But the light doesn't turn on when you open the door.  Come on Panasonic that's like one extra wire.  There is already a switch to let the microwave know it's door is open so it won't start.  And there is already a light, connect the two.  First microwave I've ever owned where the light doesn't come on when you open the door.Also this microwave lacks a quick start feature.  Most of my previous microwaves had a button you could push that would instantly start cooking and put 30 seconds on the clock.  Pushing that button again would add 30 seconds.  This is pretty much the only button I ever used.  On this Panasonic you have to push the Quick button (which puts 1 minutes on the clock, which is too long sometimes) and then press start.  It's a minor thing but it annoys me every time I use it.The power setting on this microwave is sort of dumb too.  You have to push the power button repeatedly to set the power you want.  For instance if you want 50% power you have to push the power button 5 times.  Also you MUST do this before you start cooking or put in the time.  On my other microwaves I could change power at any time and after pressing the power button I could just press a number for the percentage of power I wanted.This microwave is about an inch taller then most of them.

The huge expense to replace a combination built-in unit at this time is prohibitive, a countertop unit was the only fix. Never having a countertop microwave before, I researched several and decided, partly based on the reviews and the price, selected this unit. The input controls sequence can be a bit confusing at times, especially for food that requires more than one powerlevel cycle, but the unit does cook well. I am unsure how accurate the powerlevel settings are, the unit seems to cook fast and can easily overcook, so recommended power settings have to be reduced some. I do not like the glass turntable at all, but can overlook that some. For the money spent, it was a good buy. I am sure that it will not last another 24 years, like the built-in unit did. For an inexpensive, good looking, large enough microwave, I can recommend it.<br /><br />AFTER HAVING USED THIS MICROWAVE FOR TWO WEEKS, I MUST REVISE THIS REVIEW. IF I COULD CHANGE THE RATING TO ONE STAR, I WOULD. THIS MICROWAVE APPEARED TO BE A RETURNED ITEM WHEN I GOT IT, SEVERAL CLUES LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT. BUT I DID NOT WISH TO GO THROUGH THE HASSLE OF RETURNING, SO I DECIDED TO TRY IT. It was not damaged, except there were scuff marks on the front top bezel as well as on the bottom like bezel. The cord was not neatly wrapped, just stuffed in the box and the glass turntable was not packaged well. I now understand why this unit probably was returned by the original purchaser -- the unit will not cook correctly, the power settings do not work. It does not matter which power setting is selected, the cooking is all overcooked. Reducing the time (as I originally stated above) sometimes helps but does not always work either, the food is still crusty on the edges and overcooked. Amazon has been great in understanding this and has agreed to send me a new unit. I spoke personally with the customer service lady and she will request that I not be sent a reconditioned or returned unit. However, this is yet to be seen, but I did make it clear that if any hint of the replacement unit is a returned unit, it will immediately go back to Amazon.

21452990,R2RXOWPP5EH239,B005BFZ5ZY,4.0,2.0,2.0,N,Nice microwave! However before you ditch your old oven like I did check your mica board. It might be a $5 fix! Watch the video!!,"Just acquired one of these to replace my Stainless Steel GE 1.1 cu ft unit that was arcing and smoking after just 7 months! I owned two of the GE units. The first oven worked for 3 years then died. I replaced it with another of the same model along with a 4 year protection plan. Good thing I did! It gave me trouble after 7 months. When it died I was able to swap it for this Panasonic which I'm hoping will be more reliable.    So far I like this new microwave. The Panasonic inverter and sensor technology really seems to make a difference. Other than the noisy fan, this seems to work really well. It is very powerful and it cooks fast. It is also nice looking and well made. The sensor reheat and cook features work quite well. Inverter technology really makes the variable power settings work very well. I have only used it for two days so far. I do miss some of the GE features like the beeping every minute after the food is cooked to remind you to take it out of the oven. The GE lit up when you opened the door and allowed you to use the timer simultaneously while cooking food. It also had a 30 second button which was more useful than the minute button on the Panasonic. The GE was quieter while running. But the adjustable power level modes on the GE were not as nice as on this Panasonic unit. The GE had to cycle on and off while cooking for low power settings while the Panasonic does it smoothly with inverter technology.    Everyone out there who has a microwave they think is dying because its arcing and smoking should watch the video link below! You may just need a $5 cover for the waveguide. This is called the Mica Board. Its actually made of a grey colored mineral. If it gets wet or dirty from food or grease it will cause the oven to spark and arc badly with a scary crackling sound and bright flashes. You will think the oven is dying like I did. I just found out that this problem can often be fixed at home in a couple of minutes. You can try cleaning the old Mica Boardfirst or just get a new one for about $5. Something tells me that my old GE just needed a new mica cover. It didn't look dirty but it may have been soaked with invisible moisture or grease. I wish I knew to try fixing this before I exchanged my GE for the Panasonic under my extended warranty which I had purchased with the GE at Best Buy!

I worried that maybe the old one was leaking micro & other dangerous waves out into my home & lowering my kids' IQs or something.  So I bought this one.  It didn't heat up food as quickly or as evenly as the old one.  My husband is so ticked at me right now."

47870314,R2SX2A8JMZ4YY6,B005BFZ5ZY,4.0,4.0,6.0,N,Cooks well but has design issues,"I bought this microwave at Best Buy.  The inverter technology works great.  It is the best cooking microwave I have ever owned.  It cooks frozen entrees and vegetables very well and without the burned edges you frequently get in traditional magnetron microwaves.  I'll never buy another magnetron microwave as the inverter microwaves just cook so much better.  It seems strangly odd to be eating microwaved meals that aren't burned a bit around the edges but I think I'll get used to it.<br /><br />While the inverter cooking technology may be a big step forward, the unit itself is cheaply made and has several issues.  Here they are in no particular order:  It's a loud beast.  Easily twice as loud as any other microwave I've ever owned.  The small LED display is difficult to read from any angle other than straight on.  I have to bend over a bit when programming it to make sure I'm entering the correct info.  I've never experienced this before on a microwave and I don't know how Panasonic managed to screw this one up as LED technology is a half century old.  The interior light does not come on when the door is open.  It only lights up when the unit is operating.  The door doesn't open/close smoothly.  It has a catch when the door is about 3/4 open and requires a little extra push to get it past the catch.  You have to continuously press the power level button until it cycles around to the power level you want.  Every other microwave I've ever owned, you just hit the power level button and then hit the corresponding button on the keypad (9=90%, 8=80%, etc.) to set the power level.  Cycling through the power levels wouldn't be so bad if not for the problem mentioned about with the difficult to read LED display.<br /><br />Overall, I like the unit despite the many faults I've listed.  The inverter cooking technology makes it a winner and I can live with the faults until I find a newer inverter microwave which corrects the faults.",2014-08-17,"I bought this microwave at Best Buy.

Our first Panasonic was defective within the return period.  The replacement has worked like a charm.  So I am upgrading my review to 5 stars. --8 July 2015     Although I liked almost everything about this microwave, except for the popcorn setting which would usually burn a hole in the package even though I would open it early.  Our unit failed, but Panasonic was easy to work with and within 1.5 days, told me they'd issue a refund.  Our unit had an internal fire out the side metal plate called a wave guide.  This means that the magnetron is arching and you should unplug the unit right away.  Fixing it costs over $650, and requires removing the outer shell, replacing the magnetron, using an emery cloth to sand down all the burn marks where the interior wave guide and magnetron antenna are, spray painting the interior with &#34;microwave cavity paint&#34;, and re-assembling it. Not only that, but the unit is more likely to arc out again after repair.  I learned this thanks to &#34;Tyler Z., appliance doc&#34; (www dot justanswer dot com).

If, however, you've put the microwave on the end of a counter perpendicular to your line of sight, the numbers vanish into a sea of electronic yellow.

The controls are so similar that I didn't need to learn a lot of new things to use it. It is a little more powerful so heats quicker and that will really be the only thing I will have to get used to. It's very close to the same size but way lighter to lift for moving or cleaning under and plenty of room for anything I would need a microwave for.

For one, the beeper(both for announcing that food is done heating and when using just the timer function) does not go off for long before stopping. It beeps quietly three times and is then silent. It won't remind you that food is done and waiting for you. As an often-distracted mom, I often miss that it went off and forget my food/coffee for ages. When I try to use the timer for food that I am cooking on the stove top, I burn what I am cooking because I simply didn't hear it go off. I don't use the timer now.I also just realized that if you have the timer going, you cannot heat any food. I have to say I am very surprised that this microwave can't multitask in such a basic way.All in all, it's okay, but I expect more for the money."

I put it on a meter and found it's drawing ~25% higher amps than its 12.4A rating. Contacted Panasonic and the rep told me it should go in for repair, but the only shops he found were 90+ miles away. He said they would call back within 48 hours. They never called and I forgot. Called back weeks later and the only notes they had in the ticket were that it cooks too hot. The second rep said I should turn the power down and call back if it's still a problem. He didn't believe it was drawing too much power and wouldn't wait for me to go measure.<br /><br />I hung up and measured the draw again. 15.80-16.79A. Called back and after talking with another rep and a supervisor I'm out of luck because my warranty expired in April. That part is my fault, though I contend it's ridiculous for me to realize my microwave is drawing way more power than it's supposed to just from the fact that it burns food if the power isn't turned way down. I did tell them I have this review up telling of the problems from many months prior, but that was no help. In short, they did not have to help me, technically. Had I realize it burning food early indicated a borderline-dangerous appliance it would have been replaced a week after I purchased. Panasonic missed the chance to impress a customer and get a great review.<br />******************<br />  END UPDATE<br />******************<br /><br />Replaced a decade-old Panasonic Carousel. Had high hopes for this due to it's rating, etc. I was very excited to have a sensor that would know when my food was ready.<br /><br />PROS WORTH MENTIONING<br />- Door opening button is fine. I was afraid it would slide around and wanted one with a handle, but on top of my fridge it doesn't slide at all. Not saying this is better than a handle, just that it's no concern<br />- The door stays open. I like this very much. Our last was set to close the door and putting items in that required two hands made that difficult.<br />- Heats mostly evenly, which is a huge plus.<br /><br />CONS<br />- The largest drawback to me is it cooks too hot. I put a plate of leftovers in and use the Sensor Reheat. It burns them. There are settings to use the Sensor Reheat Less/More. Even less cooks so hot you can't think about eating the food for a while. More will never get used. Even on less my food sizzles and pops a bit. Regular means a thorough cleaning of the microwave if I don't cover something that splatters. The popcorn setting is only a touch hot, creating just a handful of slightly burned kernels.<br />- No pizza reheat setting. Seriously? I didn't hunt down a list of settings it would have and just assumed pizza or some kind of bread would be obvious on any microwave with more than about 3 pre-set food types. I was wrong. It does have a frozen pizza setting, but no pizza reheat.<br />- The timer beep (same as regular) isn't very loud or very long and does not repeat. So much for using it as an additional kitchen timer.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />Overall, I'm very underwhelmed by this microwave. If it heated more normally I would give it 4 stars. A pizza button and better timer would still keep it down from perfect. I debated 2 stars, but once I learn all the right settings for each food I'll be set, but I bought one with a sensor to avoid this.",2013-05-09,"******************************* UPDATE JULY 2014 - now 1 star*******************************I continued to have trouble and was testing the electricity in my house unrelated when I saw surges every time I ran the microwave.

Panasonic missed the chance to impress a customer and get a great review.******************  END UPDATE******************Replaced a decade-old Panasonic Carousel. Had high hopes for this due to it's rating, etc. I was very excited to have a sensor that would know when my food was ready.PROS WORTH MENTIONING- Door opening button is fine. I was afraid it would slide around and wanted one with a handle, but on top of my fridge it doesn't slide at all. Not saying this is better than a handle, just that it's no concern- The door stays open. I like this very much. Our last was set to close the door and putting items in that required two hands made that difficult.- Heats mostly evenly, which is a huge plus.CONS- The largest drawback to me is it cooks too hot. I put a plate of leftovers in and use the Sensor Reheat. It burns them. There are settings to use the Sensor Reheat Less/More. Even less cooks so hot you can't think about eating the food for a while. More will never get used. Even on less my food sizzles and pops a bit. Regular means a thorough cleaning of the microwave if I don't cover something that splatters. The popcorn setting is only a touch hot, creating just a handful of slightly burned kernels.- No pizza reheat setting. Seriously? I didn't hunt down a list of settings it would have and just assumed pizza or some kind of bread would be obvious on any microwave with more than about 3 pre-set food types. I was wrong. It does have a frozen pizza setting, but no pizza reheat.- The timer beep (same as regular) isn't very loud or very long and does not repeat. So much for using it as an additional kitchen timer.CONCLUSIONOverall, I'm very underwhelmed by this microwave. If it heated more normally I would give it 4 stars. A pizza button and better timer would still keep it down from perfect. I debated 2 stars, but once I learn all the right settings for each food I'll be set, but I bought one with a sensor to avoid this."

I like almost everything about it except for two things -: 1) the push button door opening mechanism is inferior. It seems loose after time although it has had only one person operating it from the beginning.  I thought the door mechanism seemed inferior from the beginning. Now after 4 years I may have to replace the appliance just because the door doesn't always want to open. Online research seems to imply that I need to replace the oven although it works perfectly except for the door. 2) I wish a light would come on when the door is opened so you can get a good look at the food.

We were really pleased with ours until it started arcing . . . with a dish of butter slices, no less! We fooled around with it for a while, but it started arcing with other stuff. Warming, defrosting, and melting are inportant functions in our house, and after a while, it seemed like we couldn't reliably do that anymore. Our last effort to deal with this was to reduce the power from full to 8. That seemed to work, but, by then, we decided to contact Panasonic. Right now, we are in the midst of waiting to hear from them. They authorized a local appliance repair place to come out and assess the microwave. They did and took pictures. We waited and waited, and contacted Panasonic again.

Many of the reviews for the size microwave which I needed (about 1.2 cuft) had many favorable reviews but also many reviews with concerns (typically quality) as well.

It seemed that microwaving on steady power level instead of cycling the high power off and on would result in more even cooking.<br /><br />First thing that I noticed when I got my new microwave was how much lighter it was compared to my 17 year old Sharp Microwave which had died.  Second thing which I noticed was that the microwave door would not open.  Amazon made the return process easy - UPS picked up at my house.  It took me another 2 weeks of finding time to research the reviews again before I decided to order this one yet again.  It arrived!  It worked!  Happy Days!  Point of this paragraph is that even though I am happy with the product so far there does seem to be some QC and first pass quality issues at Panasonic (it could have been damaged elsewhere but since there was no visible damage anywhere on the product or packaging, I consider that it was most likely defective at the factory - but I could be wrong).  This was not a factor in my rating of this product but I thought that it was important to share.<br /><br />I do not expect much from a microwave:  Thaw foods; Soften butter; Prepare frozen dinners; Make popcorn.  That's about it.  It does all of this fine.  I am not sure if the inverter technology is really doing much beyond meeting my basic needs so I am now thinking that this should not have been such a strong consideration in my purchase decision.

(This is the feature that lets it use a lower microwaving power instead of turning itself on and off to simulate a lower cooking power.)<br />- This microwave is very fast, and is large enough to cook almost anything.<br /><br />My complaints:<br />- I've owned the unit for about three or four months, and occasionally after starting the unit it'll just light up (but not turn on) and then turn off a couple seconds later.  I suspect this is a defective door sensor, since opening and closing the door seems to fix it.  I'm not looking forward to figuring out how to get it serviced.<br />- Setting the power level is very annoying.  Microwaves I've used in the past will let you push \\""power level\\"" and then enter a number on the keypad.  This microwave forces you to press \\""power level\\"" until the power level displayed on the screen is the one you want.  Thus, if you want power level 1 (out of 10), you have to press \\""power level\\"" 10 times.  Additionally, you can't change the power level after you've entered the time or started the cooking.  It's somewhat ironic that they made their best feature so hard to use.  I also find myself needing to lower the power level more often since this microwave is so powerful.<br />- Sensor cook/genius sensor severely overcooks everything I've tried it with.  I don't use it anymore.<br />- The beep this microwave has is incredibly loud.  I've used other microwaves that let you disable it, but this one doesn't.<br />- There are several missed opportunities for making this microwave easier to use.  For example, \\""quick min\\"" could instantly start the microwave as well, because the only thing you can do after pressing \\""quick min\\"" is press it again, press \\""start\\"", or press \\""cancel\\"", all of which you could do if it had already started anyway.

I would absolutely purchase it again!!! Easy to use, not too heavy (for those of us who aren't that strong), not too large (I still have useable counter space in front of it), many features, and accurate cooking sensors. No \\""hot spots\\"" or uncooked areas - very even cooking. The first microwave I've had with a popcorn sensor that doesn't have to be adjusted up or down a few seconds. It's great!! No problem baking cakes (the summers here can be brutal and just don't want the extra heat an oven generates in house) - the cake is light and tender, no under-or-overdone spots --- but I will always use some type of topping since the top doesn't get that nice baked golden color (just a characteristic of microwaved cakes). A standard rectangular cake pan will fit into this unit (a big plus, making it a \\""real\\"" microwave, not a small one.) Powerful too - less time to heat soup, coffee, etc than my old microwave which had the same power rating. I usually cook things for less time than recommended -- very nice -- another way of saving energy. And of course, it was delivered when promised and the packing box had no 'dings' - looked like it was waiting to be shipped. The usual Amazon quality.    Now, just a few minor things keeping it from getting 5 stars. If permitted I would give it 4.5 stars.  First, it is louder than expected. The motor can just be heard in adjacent rooms. If speaking on the phone I move about 5 feet away. And the door is a bit loud when closed (we don't slam the door but close it slowly and gently.) However I don't think this is enough to discourage anyone from buying this model. It has quite a few features and cooks superbly. I really hope it lasts a long time.    SADLY IT DIED TODAY. SHOWED ERROR CODE H98 - has become dangerous to use. Either of the 2 parts which may be at fault, when coupled with labor charge, are higher than cost of new microwave. Yesterday it behaved strangely: had to restart several times, took longer to cook. Same today but also made a few snapping/sizzling sounds and turned off after about 10 seconds. When restarted it showed H98 code. I dont think a higher rated Panasonic should die after 2.5 yrs -- or has construction just become too cheap. Should have lasted minimum 10yrs or so.

I usually cook things for less time than recommended -- very nice -- another way of saving energy. And of course, it was delivered when promised and the packing box had no 'dings' - looked like it was waiting to be shipped. The usual Amazon quality.    Now, just a few minor things keeping it from getting 5 stars. If permitted I would give it 4.5 stars.  First, it is louder than expected. The motor can just be heard in adjacent rooms. If speaking on the phone I move about 5 feet away. And the door is a bit loud when closed (we don't slam the door but close it slowly and gently.) However I don't think this is enough to discourage anyone from buying this model. It has quite a few features and cooks superbly. I really hope it lasts a long time.    SADLY IT DIED TODAY. SHOWED ERROR CODE H98 - has become dangerous to use. Either of the 2 parts which may be at fault, when coupled with labor charge, are higher than cost of new microwave. Yesterday it behaved strangely: had to restart several times, took longer to cook. Same today but also made a few snapping/sizzling sounds and turned off after about 10 seconds. When restarted it showed H98 code. I dont think a higher rated Panasonic should die after 2.5 yrs -- or has construction just become too cheap. Should have lasted minimum 10yrs or so. Will not purchase another. Changed rating from 4 to 2 stars."

So after reading many reviews on other models, I took a chance and chose this one. I primarily use my microwave to boil water for my morning instant coffee. My sharp boiled 2 cups of water in 5:25 minutes. This unit boils 2 cups of water in 3:30 minutes. It also heats up food much faster. It has a lot of features I will likely never use and it looks good. I've had this about 45 days now and I have no complaints. I am very happy.<br /><br />Update: It has been about ten months now and it is still running fine. I use it two or three time a day and it takes my abuse of boiled over water from my [[ASIN:B000YT2XOI Fasta Pasta - The Microwave Cooker]] and refuses to quit. Still very happy with it. The only minor quibble I have is that when it is finished cooking an the timer runs down to zero, it beeps to let you know. But the beep is so quiet that I don't hear it when I'm in the next room. I wish it was a little louder.",2012-07-15,"I needed to replace my former Microwave in a hurry. I wanted another Sharp but couldn't find one that would be delivered fast enough.

I like it so much better than my older units that when on reduced power cooking, it just gave you shorter durations of full power heating.  This unit actually reduces the cooking power over the total cooking time.  I no longer experience overheated spots on my defrosted meats. I seldom actually cook anything in it, other than fresh vegetables.  I mostly re-heat left-overs, de-frost meats, heat frozen dishes, and quickly boil water when needed.  However, the \\""inverter\\"" funtion is about all that I really like about this model.<br /><br />The things that I was dissatisfied with are: The interior light does not come on when the door is open; it is not a quiet operating unit, if fact, I would describe it as quite noisey; there is a 5 beep alarm that sounds upon the completion of the heating cycle, but no further notice alerting you that food is still in the microwave awaiting to be removed; you cannot use the timer function if your heating something in the microwave; and finally the opening and closing of the oven door is very hard to do.  The force required to push the \\""door open button\\"" is quite excessive.  I doubt children under the age of 15 would be able to open it, and you cannot just push the door closed, you nearly have to slam it closed.  So, in short I have very mixed feelings about recommending this unit to anyone.<br /><br />(An update after two years of use)  The microwave still operates, although, lately I'm starting to notice the machine stopping during the heating cycle and clearing the control panel settings.  So if I'm there at the time this happens, I have to guesstimate the remaining time needed and re-set the control panel accordingly.
