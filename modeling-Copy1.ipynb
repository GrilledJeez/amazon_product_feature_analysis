However we contacted Amazon & they sent UPS to pick that one up & sent us another one from Fex Ex the next day & it works fine. We were very happy with Amazon customer service. The product works well I have to get used to it I always had a Sharp. It is a little higher watts so I have to get used to it cooking faster. I used to have buttons to push for designated cooking on the Sharp not so much on this but the sensor feature works well. It was $30 cheaper on Amazon than if we bought it at Best Buy plus free shipping & no tax! Overall very pleased it is a good product.\n",

      "After looking at reviews from many brands on both Amazon and Consumer Reports I realized there are no quality microwaves currently available. So I settled on the Panasonic H965 which doesn't seem to last very long but at least doesn't burst into flames. I'm replacing a 16 year old Kenmore (which burst into flames after heating a few baked potatoes for 8 minutes). Thanks to all the Amazon reviews, I protected myself with a 4 year extended warranty but I'd hoped I'd get a few years out of it before having to use the warranty.    It arrived yesterday, Dead on Arrival. Well, it wasn't actually dead but the number keys 3-9 were not functional. You could microwave anything as long as you didn't need these numbers. You could set your clock as long as you waited until the current time didn't require numbers in the 3-9 range.. :-).. Very disappointing.. but alas not surprising... It's too bad that nowadays one seems to have to count on luck hoping to get a working, reliable microwave. Now the question is... Are microwave ovens becoming throw-aways like many other thing??  Do I replace this one with a Panasonic or something else which may be just as bad??\n",

I was wrong -- the sensor cooking does work and I use it all the time.  For example, to cook any type of fresh vegetable, I just select fresh vegetable and hit start -- no weight, time, or type of vegetable.  It's really simple and the vegetables are cooked perfectly.

Unfortunately it is failing in less than a year! After placing food in the microwave and setting time, it may or may not start when you hit the &#34;start&#34; button. We have to slam the door multiple times until it actually starts..... Really frustrating! It is just shy of the 1-warranty expiration date.

No error message, just no power and a blank display. Nearest repair facility is 42 miles away. Made the mistake of throwing away the box believing that the Panasonic brand would be a good indicator of longevity. (Prior Sharp carousel lasted 17 years)  Repair facilities (3 queried) could not guarantee a one day turnaround and estimated repair time was one to three weeks. 42 miles x 4 equates to a significant time and gas cost figure.

      "We purchased this oven (in stainless trim) a few weeks ago to replace a Sharp microwave that kept blowing up food and catching fire from liquids that would get behind the megatron cover and ignite. The inverter technology is the only way to go with a microwave oven, which allows the power to actually step down rather than simply cycling on and off at 100%, which all other ovens do. So far we've had no food blowing up or cooking over in this oven. If our much older, second Sharp microwave ever dies, it will be replaced with one of these as well.\n",

      "I ordered this microwave due to being familiar with the quality of Panasonic products. When I received the microwave oven I installed it and heated a cup of coffee to test it. It  did not seem as hot as it should be but I did not reheat it as it was late so went to bed. I made coffee the next am and then placed the cup into the oven. After programming the time, I pushed the start switch and the microwave cut on for about 2 seconds then cut off. I checked everything and it was programmed properly so tried it again with the same results.  After trying several times with the same results I called a dealer whom I knew serviced Panasonic several years ago. The owner said they would not service the Microwave as Panasonic would not pay their bills.  He told me there were no more service  personnel who would service the brand in the area due to the same problem. I called Panasonic and explained the problem I was having. The lady said &#34; You definitely have a problem. You can send it back to us and we will repair it and charge you for the service charge.&#34; I cut in and said, I pay for shippping it to you, pay you to repair a new product just received and cannot use, which you agree is defective, then pay for shipping it back to me, no thanks! I opted to have Amazon .com replace it and they were super. The replacement, is the same brand and model and works great but based on Panasonics response I would not recommend this microwave to anyone.\n",

      "Our unit lasted only five months and one week!  My wife and I used it daily, about 10-15 times per day, mostly for heating water for coffee or tea, approximately two minutes thirty seconds per use. The date of manufacture was July 2013. We purchased it in March 2014. We noticed a slight smoke odor one morning, and three days later the unit died while heating a cup of water.    The Amazon return policy only covers 30 days from date of purchase so we had to contact Panasonic for repairs.    It took two phone calls to get Panasonic's full attention. With the first call, on a Friday, we were assigned a case number, and told a rep would contact us within 24-48 hours. When that didn't happen, we called again the following Tuesday. From that point, however, the procedure went surprisingly quickly and smoothly. We received a postage paid recycled shipping box within three days. The box was picked up by Fedex the next morning and shipped from West Virginia to Maryland (the nearest repair site). One week later, we received the repaired unit. The shipping insert indicated a printed wiring board had failed.    The entire period, from failure to repair, was about 17 days. This is a long time to go without a microwave, but a relatively short time for getting a unit shipped, repaired and returned. So kudos to Panasonic for being nimble. Not knowing how long we might have had to wait, we purchased a 1000W Fridaire unit from a local Lowe's for the interim. We actually like the Frigidaire unit better. It's slightly smaller, does the job, and doesn't interfere with nearby WiFi devices. This latter phenomenon we found a little spooky. Every time we used the Panasonic, the Internet Radio in our kitchen would cut out until the microwave was done. Was this interference due to harmful microwave leakage? Who knows?    Conclusion: We will keep the Panasonic as backup, and stay with the Frigidaire replacement.\n",

      "In late 2012, our 23 year-old Sharp microwave died. I called an appliance repair shop. They laughed. Nicely, but still…laughter. After much research I settled on this model because it fit the space we had available, looked simple to operate and, got good  reviews. I've had it for over a year and can say without reservation that I'm happy with this microwave. I don't use many of the cooking options--just straight minutes or, a feature which I love, the quick minute button. It feels very sturdy, though it's not built like my Sharp tank, especially the top, which is definitely thinner. But it's also more powerful than what I'd been used to, which means I had to adjust to faster cooking times (a good change), and it's much lighter, making it easier to move out for cleaning the counter underneath and behind. I'm giving it four stars only because, though I've had it for over a year, it seems premature to say it's perfect. But if it's still working in three years I'll come back and edit. In the meantime, based on a year's experience, I can definitely recommend it. Edit: 4-14-16. I still love it! No problems except the door sticks a little.\n",

Second, the door broke after only a few months (you had to use two hands to open it).  Third, and worst of all, it completely stopped working after only 7 months.  How can a product last less than 1 year??? I've never been so disappointed in a purchase.  I feel like I have no recourse because I bought it online.

      "When my 25 year-old microwave died I started looking for a replacement.  After reading a number of reviews I settled on the Panasonic for several reasons.  One, I'm familiar with several Sharp ovens and a number of them have problems with their displays.  For example, my sister's Sharp has a problem with the numbers and when you enter, for example, a nine it will read 1 with the parts of the nine that make it a nine left off.  A 7 will also read as 1.  Her oven still works fine and times correctly for the numbers you punch in, but the readout problem means you have to pay attention to the numbers you enter.  Of the four Sharp ovens I've been around, all four suffer from that same fault.  Two, I wanted one big enough to use a 9x13 dish in and the Panasonic does.  While other ovens will also accommodate a 9x13 dish, they are larger ovens and take up more counter space.  This is the smallest oven that I found which can handle my 9x13 dishes and still rotate them on the turntable.  Some of the other ovens close to this size might handle 9x13 dishes provided the dishes don't have flanges on the ends to aid in lifting them as mine do.  Anyhow, it will accommodate the size dishes I wanted to be able to use.  Three, it has a sensor and I wanted to try one with it and see if it was an improvement.  Four, it happened to be on sale at the time.    After using it for three weeks I'm very happy with the oven.  It is much faster than the old one, which I expected, but it also cooks much more uniformly.  While I expected some improvement in uniformity, I received much more than I expected.  I am also very pleased with the sensor system.  As I mentioned earlier, I wanted to try a sensor oven, but did not realize that I would use it most of the time.  You want to nuke some potatoes, you do not have to figure out how much time per potato and multiply that by the number of potatoes.  Just poke your holes, punch sensor cook until it reads potatoes, and hit start.  I do find it does a better job if you turn your potatoes over after it beeps twice, but even if you don't it does an acceptable job.  The sensor reheat also works better than I expected and I find myself depending upon it rather than standing there and deciding I'll give the dish a couple of minutes and see it that's enough.  Lastly, the feature I like the best is the turbo defrost.  My old Kenmore required a lot of fiddling to do a good job of defrosting such as adjusting the output and making sure to turn the food over several times during defrost with several waiting periods mixed in.  While this oven still requires some fiddling, it requires far less and does a better job of defrosting without partially cooking.  On small portions all you need do is enter the weight and hit start, but with bigger portions it works best by turning over, and with large portions of items like ground beef you need to scrape off the defrosted meat part way through the process to avoid partial cooking.  Since most of the time the portions I'm defrosting fall into the smaller category I don't have to do anything more than enter the weight and allow the oven to do the rest.    On the con side, I don't like the way the turntable drive system engages the platter.  It works fine, but you have to peer in and align the dogs on the bottom of the platter with their respective recesses in the drive flange.  That is not earthshaking, but it is a miner aggravation.  I can think of several ways to design the system so it would be easier to install the platter so it engaged the drive dogs correctly.    So as it stands, provided the oven is as reliable as the other Panasonic products I've used I heartily recommend it and so far I see no reason to think it won't be.  I was also pleased with the service and price from Amazon, but I've come to expect that level of service and pricing from them.  I've only had one foul up with an Amazon order, and when they were notified of the problem they quickly corrected it, in fact much more quickly than I expected.  You can't ask or expect more.\n",

It cooked evenly and gave me no problems.<br /><br />After regular household use for more than a decade the microwave started to periodically short out and trip the breaker.  I wasn't about to risk continuing to use it so I disconnected it and started shopping for a replacement.  After looking at countless makes and models and every online review I could find I decided to buy this model.  It was only then that I realized that this is the very same model I was replacing except for the colour.<br /><br />I have been using the replacement (#2) for a couple of months now and it is working as well as the last one.

      "Liked it for the most part until it died after 2 years, almost to the day. Pros: inverter defrost. Put in weight of item and it defrosted fairly well without cooking. Cons: popcorn setting is MISERABLE. Never popped correctly even when not using the popcorn setting. Would either undercook (tons of old maids) or scorch. The door stopped closing nicely after about a year. I thought the door latching mechanism would fail before the actual unit did. I was wrong. Now when I push the button - the light goes on, but turntable doesn't move, fan doesn't come on/make noise, then it shuts itself off. Paid $200 for this unit 2 years ago: at $100/year, not worth it.

      "We bought this microwave in 2008 and have been using it every day for the past six years.<br />This 1250 watt Panasonic microwave is terrific.  First off, it is very sleek to look at; we have ours caddy-cornered at a countertop bend and as appliances go, this black microwave looks attractive.  The buttons are neatly laid out on the panel, the interface is simple and the LED readout is a pleasant green.  It rests on four hard rubber feet in the corners which keep the microwave firmly planted and vibration free during operation.  The power output on this microwave is very high, it took some getting used to not overcook things.  Even now, we do not cook things for the entire recommended times food packages say as we have learned how to compensate for this microwaves higher power.  Plus, there is a power level function that allows you to cook at lower power settings if your cooking needs require.  The Invertor defrost is a good function that defrosts frozen foods fairly even as well.<br />Overall, this microwave was an excellent choice and has stood the test of time extremely well.  I do not hesitate to recommend it.  At the time we bought it, this microwave came recommended as a Consumer Reports top pick.<br />I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review.\n",

It was still working, but the seal around the door cracked and fell out in big chunks.<br />I did my research on the newer style of microwaves and decided on this model #1. because of the ability to use the different levels of power, &#34;this feature is great and works very well&#34;.  The auto setting actually reheat food perfectly.  Pop corn setting you set by the size of the package , to defrost you put in the weight of the item to be thawed and it works well.  #2.  This oven was the correct size to fit the space of my previous one so that was a good thing.<br />I have been using it for about a month now and am very pleased.  If it will last even half the years of my sharp I will be happy.  As the cost was less than half what I had paid for the sharp.<br />grizzyt\n",
