      "I ordered this microwave due to being familiar with the quality of Panasonic products. When I received the microwave oven I installed it and heated a cup of coffee to test it. It  did not seem as hot as it should be but I did not reheat it as it was late so went to bed. I made coffee the next am and then placed the cup into the oven. After programming the time, I pushed the start switch and the microwave cut on for about 2 seconds then cut off. I checked everything and it was programmed properly so tried it again with the same results.  After trying several times with the same results I called a dealer whom I knew serviced Panasonic several years ago. The owner said they would not service the Microwave as Panasonic would not pay their bills.  He told me there were no more service  personnel who would service the brand in the area due to the same problem. I called Panasonic and explained the problem I was having. The lady said &#34; You definitely have a problem. You can send it back to us and we will repair it and charge you for the service charge.&#34; I cut in and said, I pay for shippping it to you, pay you to repair a new product just received and cannot use, which you agree is defective, then pay for shipping it back to me, no thanks! I opted to have Amazon .com replace it and they were super. The replacement, is the same brand and model and works great but based on Panasonics response I would not recommend this microwave to anyone.\n",

      "Our unit lasted only five months and one week!  My wife and I used it daily, about 10-15 times per day, mostly for heating water for coffee or tea, approximately two minutes thirty seconds per use. The date of manufacture was July 2013. We purchased it in March 2014. We noticed a slight smoke odor one morning, and three days later the unit died while heating a cup of water.    The Amazon return policy only covers 30 days from date of purchase so we had to contact Panasonic for repairs.    It took two phone calls to get Panasonic's full attention. With the first call, on a Friday, we were assigned a case number, and told a rep would contact us within 24-48 hours. When that didn't happen, we called again the following Tuesday. From that point, however, the procedure went surprisingly quickly and smoothly. We received a postage paid recycled shipping box within three days. The box was picked up by Fedex the next morning and shipped from West Virginia to Maryland (the nearest repair site). One week later, we received the repaired unit. The shipping insert indicated a printed wiring board had failed.    The entire period, from failure to repair, was about 17 days. This is a long time to go without a microwave, but a relatively short time for getting a unit shipped, repaired and returned. So kudos to Panasonic for being nimble. Not knowing how long we might have had to wait, we purchased a 1000W Fridaire unit from a local Lowe's for the interim. We actually like the Frigidaire unit better. It's slightly smaller, does the job, and doesn't interfere with nearby WiFi devices. This latter phenomenon we found a little spooky. Every time we used the Panasonic, the Internet Radio in our kitchen would cut out until the microwave was done. Was this interference due to harmful microwave leakage? Who knows?    Conclusion: We will keep the Panasonic as backup, and stay with the Frigidaire replacement.\n",

      "In late 2012, our 23 year-old Sharp microwave died. I called an appliance repair shop. They laughed. Nicely, but stillâ€¦laughter. After much research I settled on this model because it fit the space we had available, looked simple to operate and, got good  reviews. I've had it for over a year and can say without reservation that I'm happy with this microwave. I don't use many of the cooking options--just straight minutes or, a feature which I love, the quick minute button. It feels very sturdy, though it's not built like my Sharp tank, especially the top, which is definitely thinner. But it's also more powerful than what I'd been used to, which means I had to adjust to faster cooking times (a good change), and it's much lighter, making it easier to move out for cleaning the counter underneath and behind. I'm giving it four stars only because, though I've had it for over a year, it seems premature to say it's perfect. But if it's still working in three years I'll come back and edit. In the meantime, based on a year's experience, I can definitely recommend it. Edit: 4-14-16. I still love it! No problems except the door sticks a little.\n",

Second, the door broke after only a few months (you had to use two hands to open it).  Third, and worst of all, it completely stopped working after only 7 months.  How can a product last less than 1 year??? I've never been so disappointed in a purchase.  I feel like I have no recourse because I bought it online.

      "When my 25 year-old microwave died I started looking for a replacement.  After reading a number of reviews I settled on the Panasonic for several reasons.  One, I'm familiar with several Sharp ovens and a number of them have problems with their displays.  For example, my sister's Sharp has a problem with the numbers and when you enter, for example, a nine it will read 1 with the parts of the nine that make it a nine left off.  A 7 will also read as 1.  Her oven still works fine and times correctly for the numbers you punch in, but the readout problem means you have to pay attention to the numbers you enter.  Of the four Sharp ovens I've been around, all four suffer from that same fault.  Two, I wanted one big enough to use a 9x13 dish in and the Panasonic does.  While other ovens will also accommodate a 9x13 dish, they are larger ovens and take up more counter space.  This is the smallest oven that I found which can handle my 9x13 dishes and still rotate them on the turntable.  Some of the other ovens close to this size might handle 9x13 dishes provided the dishes don't have flanges on the ends to aid in lifting them as mine do.  Anyhow, it will accommodate the size dishes I wanted to be able to use.  Three, it has a sensor and I wanted to try one with it and see if it was an improvement.  Four, it happened to be on sale at the time.    After using it for three weeks I'm very happy with the oven.  It is much faster than the old one, which I expected, but it also cooks much more uniformly.  While I expected some improvement in uniformity, I received much more than I expected.  I am also very pleased with the sensor system.  As I mentioned earlier, I wanted to try a sensor oven, but did not realize that I would use it most of the time.  You want to nuke some potatoes, you do not have to figure out how much time per potato and multiply that by the number of potatoes.  Just poke your holes, punch sensor cook until it reads potatoes, and hit start.  I do find it does a better job if you turn your potatoes over after it beeps twice, but even if you don't it does an acceptable job.  The sensor reheat also works better than I expected and I find myself depending upon it rather than standing there and deciding I'll give the dish a couple of minutes and see it that's enough.  Lastly, the feature I like the best is the turbo defrost.  My old Kenmore required a lot of fiddling to do a good job of defrosting such as adjusting the output and making sure to turn the food over several times during defrost with several waiting periods mixed in.  While this oven still requires some fiddling, it requires far less and does a better job of defrosting without partially cooking.  On small portions all you need do is enter the weight and hit start, but with bigger portions it works best by turning over, and with large portions of items like ground beef you need to scrape off the defrosted meat part way through the process to avoid partial cooking.  Since most of the time the portions I'm defrosting fall into the smaller category I don't have to do anything more than enter the weight and allow the oven to do the rest.    On the con side, I don't like the way the turntable drive system engages the platter.  It works fine, but you have to peer in and align the dogs on the bottom of the platter with their respective recesses in the drive flange.  That is not earthshaking, but it is a miner aggravation.  I can think of several ways to design the system so it would be easier to install the platter so it engaged the drive dogs correctly.    So as it stands, provided the oven is as reliable as the other Panasonic products I've used I heartily recommend it and so far I see no reason to think it won't be.  I was also pleased with the service and price from Amazon, but I've come to expect that level of service and pricing from them.  I've only had one foul up with an Amazon order, and when they were notified of the problem they quickly corrected it, in fact much more quickly than I expected.  You can't ask or expect more.\n",

      "Being deployed it's nice to have certain things while away. One of those things is a microwave. I found this one and ordered it on 25 August 2011 and it was in my hands through an APO address on 30 August 2011 with the free shipping. The estimated arrival to Afghanistan was 16 September 2011. Talk about supporting the troops. Great job Amazon. Also this microwave works like a charm and fits the DFAC to-go plates perfect. Thanks again.\n",

I was very pleased with Amazon.com. They kept me informed from purchase to arrival. The new microwave is excellent. The sensor reheat is easy to use and leftovers are perfectly heated. It was easy to set up with clear instructions. Even had some recipes and I have tried the Tuna Casserole. It was good, but made it twice and the second time used two 6 Oz cans of tuna.

      "I bought this microwave in white from a retail store about a decade ago.  I loved it from day one becuase it had all the features I wanted and needed and worked really well.  It cooked evenly and gave me no problems.<br /><br />After regular household use for more than a decade the microwave started to periodically short out and trip the breaker.  I wasn't about to risk continuing to use it so I disconnected it and started shopping for a replacement.  After looking at countless makes and models and every online review I could find I decided to buy this model.  It was only then that I realized that this is the very same model I was replacing except for the colour.<br /><br />I have been using the replacement (#2) for a couple of months now and it is working as well as the last one.  I like it every bit as much.  The astounding thing about this second purchase was the exceptionally low price I paid on Amazon.  How do they get the price so low?<br /><br />The item was nicely packed by the manufacturer with an exterior box around the standard packaging.  This was an excellent buy and shopping experience.\n",

      "Liked it for the most part until it died after 2 years, almost to the day. Pros: inverter defrost. Put in weight of item and it defrosted fairly well without cooking. Cons: popcorn setting is MISERABLE. Never popped correctly even when not using the popcorn setting. Would either undercook (tons of old maids) or scorch. The door stopped closing nicely after about a year. I thought the door latching mechanism would fail before the actual unit did. I was wrong. Now when I push the button - the light goes on, but turntable doesn't move, fan doesn't come on/make noise, then it shuts itself off. Paid $200 for this unit 2 years ago: at $100/year, not worth it. My last microwave was a Sharp and it lasted 10 years. I think I'm going back to that brand.\n",

      "I bought this microwave because the one I had was 15 years old.  Before choosing this microwave I looked at many brands.  I was looking for size, wattage, color, ease of use.  This microwave will fit a casserole dish inside.  It is very easy to use.  The time it takes to heat an item is only a few minutes.  I have the preset for my favorite popcorn.  The inverter technology allows even temperature in reheating, cooking, defrosting and  keeping dishes warm until serving time without drying out.  You also have the normal settings for your power levels, timer and clock.  This  is a lighter weight microwave and does move on the counter top with opening and closing the door which also feels flimsy.  I put a skid mat under it.  It is a beautiful appliance,  I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend it.\n",

      "We bought this microwave in 2008 and have been using it every day for the past six years.<br />This 1250 watt Panasonic microwave is terrific.  First off, it is very sleek to look at; we have ours caddy-cornered at a countertop bend and as appliances go, this black microwave looks attractive.  The buttons are neatly laid out on the panel, the interface is simple and the LED readout is a pleasant green.  It rests on four hard rubber feet in the corners which keep the microwave firmly planted and vibration free during operation.  The power output on this microwave is very high, it took some getting used to not overcook things.  Even now, we do not cook things for the entire recommended times food packages say as we have learned how to compensate for this microwaves higher power.  Plus, there is a power level function that allows you to cook at lower power settings if your cooking needs require.  The Invertor defrost is a good function that defrosts frozen foods fairly even as well.<br />Overall, this microwave was an excellent choice and has stood the test of time extremely well.  I do not hesitate to recommend it.  At the time we bought it, this microwave came recommended as a Consumer Reports top pick.<br />I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review.\n",

      "Ordered this microwave for my parents. 3 weeks after purchase, the thing stops working. The digital screen shows an \\\\\"H98 error\\\\\" message, even after unplugging and plugging back in. We checked the owners manual, which explained that when this error message shows up there's a problem with the generator and the microwave needs to go back to the manufacturer. My parents threw away the box, so now we have to go through the extra hassle of finding a new box and shipping the whole thing back to amazon. I am so irritated by this poorly manufactured lemon of a microwave. Beware this product!\n",

      "I've had this microwave for several weeks and have no complaints so far. It seems to have stronger cooking power than other microwaves I've used so I will try lowering to 80-90% power for some food. The turntable is nice and the microwave is extremely roomy inside.\n",

      "This unit works well. It heats faster than the old microwave that we replaced. Plus it has a superior display and lacks the grating tune that the old one had.<br /><br />A note about it being hard to close...it does indeed take a bit of force to either close the door or release it via pushbutton and I imagine that could be a problem if this is set up on a counter, unless the back of the microwave is hard against a wall. Ours is installed in a cubby that hangs below a kitchen cabinet and the back of our Panasonic is up against solid wood.\n",
