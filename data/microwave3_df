Until it stopped working.,"I really like this microwave after about six months of use. My only criticism is that you have to hit the Start button after hitting Quick Minute cooking - Quick Minute would really be Quick if it just started right away. Otherwise it's great, it's fast, easy to use, and cleans up easily.<br /><br />Update after 18 months of use: This microwave has almost stopped working because of the structural problems with the latching system (I've seen a lot of people talking about this online so I know that we were not the only ones). Since a few months ago, closing the door would make all the lights on the panel go off, so you cannot reheat anything. We started slamming the door to get it to come on again. The problem has gotten worse and worse to the point that even 15 or 20 hard slams will not wake it up again. We liked this but will buy another model this time, and will definitely pay for the extended purchase protection plan next time in case this Panasonic latching problem crops up again.",2015-08-11

My GE brand built in gave up the ghost after 2 yrs. I bought this one a year or so ago, and probably would still be using it, had my wife not used it for an oven timer, setting on high for ten min. with nothing inside it. ( ok, brain fart) smelled plastic burning, small 3 in flame, doused with baking soda, actually only the plastic ring the plate sits on melted. For others, bound and determined to use as timer mode, I would suggest  ten min on timer, power lever on 1, or perhaps on defrost, and take your chance on timed mode.  New one in hand, this feels like and old friend. I love the knob turning instead of countless button pushing. The popcorn  setting works good, press it twice for normal microwave bags. The inverter type' nucking option is better than other microwave cycling on high, 5sec. nothing, than high again.

After reading the reviews we ordered this microwave. At first we were a little nervous about there being no number pad and how the dial might be more novelty than functional.  But man, we love the dial.  It's super responsive to how fast or slow you turn and after just using it once or twice we found it actually easier to set timers with the flick of your wrist than setting it on our old microwave with the number pad.  The knob protrudes more than you're think for easy use but pushes back in so it's out of the way. We are in the middle of remodeling our kitchen so we are using the microwave more than we'd like to admit, but we've definitely put it through it's paces. The sensor reheat setting is great for leftovers, it basically senses steam  and will shut off at that point leaving you hot, but not lava hot food.  It also heats really evenly compared to our old microwave.

The carosel drive feature is very difficult to engage without knocking the rollers out of place. It is virtually impossible for my wife to load the oven with a heavy dish without disengaging the drive. The time setting program for the rotary knob is well, stupid. It is not possible to set it for something between 1:20 and 1:30. Going up is fine. It accelerates from single seconds to blocks of 5 seconds, then 10 seconds, then 15 seconds and finally 30 seconds. All they need to do to fix the problem would be to do the same thing on the way down. The if you found 17 seconds heated the baby bottle perfectly, you could wind up to 20 seconds and then back down one second at a time to 17 seconds. I call this a big duh. Or maybe it should be a blinding glimpse of the obvious! As for the claimed even heating, well they must have advertized it that way because some rookie engineer spent way too much money trying to make it work without success. Test it with a stick of butter placed in any orientation and you will get a stick with a hole drilled thru long before the whole of it melts. I have long counted on Panasonic to give me good value and good products in HI-FI, kitchen and car products. But for the life of me, I cannot understand why they put their name on this one. I sure wish I could contact someone in Panasonic engineering because I really hate to see them going down this road.<br />P.S. a stupid problem common to many brands and models, such as this one, I cannot understand is the insistence one must listen to the finished cooking alarm all the way through, even after the door is opened.

The inverter technology works. At lower power settings, other ovens pulse energy at 100%. This one actually reduces the intensity of the power in a constant flow, which means more even heating. If anything, settings are biased AGAINST overheating, which I really appreciate. The &#34;Genius&#34; aspect of reheating food is partly based on the amount of steam that is produced. If you use a plastic dome like the NordicWare to cover a plate, the steam flow is reduced. So it can throw this sensor off a bit. It sill works, but the food will be rather hot.<br /><br />A few minor things…I wish the Start and Stop buttons were significantly larger than the others. Many have complained about the light, which goes off after cooking. Yes, it seems that Panasonic would just &#34;give&#34; this feature back. That said, there's never a time that I've opened it and said to myself, &#34;I really wish the light were on.&#34; That it stays on during cooking is almost meaningless, as the protective grid on the door admits very little light.<br /><br />I also bought this unit as much for its appearance as anything else. It looks great on the counter. And I love the adjustment knob as opposed to a keypad. It is stainless steel, so it shows everything. I just use window cleaner sprayed onto a paper towel…cleaning takes a couple minutes at most. This oven also feels and appears to be very solidly engineered. The feel of the door closing is absolutely solid. Some have commented on the sound of the blower fan. My unit sits in a corner under a cabinet, so I actually feel it's really quiet.

The ability to cook at multiple power levels and the ease of the control panel to do so makes this an indispensable appliance for us. We often start on high and finish cooking at a lower temp for longer to avoid torching or mushing a casserole or minimize &#34;splatter&#34; in uncovered dishes. Plus, the sensor reheat feature works fantastic but not always perfect; it's a matter of what you're reheating and how you position the food (if/when possible) when cooking the bowl/plate. Don't expect a big lump of food to cook evenly on reheat, but spread it out or create an open cavity in the food in the bowl/plate and it cooks quickly w/o splatter. This is the cleanest microwave we've ever owned because of the ability to gauge the temperature more accurately because of the sensor reheat and dial access to adjust the time. Oh, it's also pretty quiet and easy on the eye...very neutral design; we eliminated our over-the-stove microwave beast for this clean, mean machine and will never go back.",2015-03-13

Unfortunately I'm not sure what that lesson might be. Microwave ovens nowdays are all made in the same 3 factories in Asia. People refuse to pay what a quality microwave oven costs and manufacturers are forced to sell these cheap ripoffs that last 3 years *IF you're very lucky.* You literally cannot buy a quality consumer microwave oven anymore. After this oven quit I put my 30 year-old Sharp oven back and have started using that again. It's too small and doesn't have a rotating pedestal but it does the job it's been doing for 3 decades.

I did buy the Square Trade warranty just in case as ST is just great. I bought my parents a very expensive Breville toaster oven and it died after 2 years -- it had great reviews. Fortunately the ST warranty saved the day and we got our money back and bought a cheaper one. So for any sort of expensive appliance I get the ST warranty because you never know when you will get a lemon.,2015-02-16

It has a button you push and depending on what number you put in it supposed to automatically cook your item. Now, unless you want to keep your manufacturers book handy at all times or you want to memorize all the cooking procedures it's a pain. The warmer or inverter button works sporadically well, meaning sometimes it works well for what you're trying to melt or soften, and sometimes it burns or doesn't do anything.

Microwave stopped working after eight months. Light use: used only for reheating food perhaps once a day. Microwave runs for three seconds and then shuts down.  Called Panasonic and provided a local repair shop to bring the microwave unit to since it is still under warranty.  Repair shop informed me the next day that there were two defective parts (inverter and meagnetron). One of these parts in on back order and the estimated lead time is at least 30 days. Called Panasonic and they told that there is nothing they can do but to wait for the parts to be available.<br />The microwave oven is not that expensive but Panasonic's response to their defective product is a total let down.

When we turned that oven on it had a loud sizzling/buzzing sound, and I thought the system was going to explode. We tried it several times, and the same sound kept occurring throughout the 'on' cycle. So we sent the 2nd oven back and kept the first one. If I had purchased it locally in a store, I would have returned both. But it was too much of a hassle to return the first one. These ovens obviously aren't very well-manufactured [in China]...  Also, although the glass turntable is the same size as in my previous Panasonic microwave, the inside space is much smaller. This has a negative impact on the size and shape of dish/casserole I can fit in the oven. As I mentioned, it does the job.

Bad Customer Service,"In an effort to make everything shiny and modern, Panasonic has made a microwave that is terrible to use. Each button is the same as the button next to it.

Just pull out the manual (you keep the manual on the counter next to the microwave, right?) then try to find the page with the cooking numbers listed.  This unit was designed by people who got &#34;C&#34;s  in design school.<br /><br />So we used the microwave for 6 months, then one day it caught fire.<br /><br />That's right - caught fire!  We brought it to a panasonic authorized repair shop. It was under warranty. You'd think Panasonic would immediately authorize a replacement or a refund within a few days, right? The circuitry had clearly caught fire!!  Nope. The main Panasonic office in a dark far-away cave somewhere wanted photos. When I called a week later the repair shop didn't have any new information. I said I needed to get some idea of the timeframe - will they be repairing in a week, sending me a new one, giving me credit and I should buy a new one myself...? We now don't have a microwave in the house.  Turns out Panasonic never got the photos from the repair shop. A week later I still hadn't heard back. I was told they' get back to me by the end of the day. 2 days later they still hadn't. Finally, 3 weeks after bringing it in, they said that Panasonic will issue me a refund but the repair shop wasn't sure it they were going to mail it to me or the service center. I asked them to find out. That was 2 days ago.<br /><br />Panasonic made a flawed product (hey, it happens) but they and the people they allow to represent them don't seem to care.

It is powerful, attractive, has a nice blue display which is easy on the eyes, and has what they can an \\""Inverter\\"" sensor element which seems to vary heating strength gradually during the microwave cycle when used. I've used it successfully several times, defrosted solid items well, and it even cooks popcorn well. The popcorn setting has a good feature; if you hit the button repeatedly, it gives you three different ounce sizes to carefully adjust to the bag-size to prevent burning or too many unpopped kernels. Oven size is very good with a 14\\"" plate; an average but modest turkey will fit, and definitely a full chicken. So far no regrets; it outperforms our last very good Sharp Oven which died after 7-8 years or so.",2014-06-03

It has a dial to set the cook time & no numeric keypad at all. This is just plain dumb. Believe me, you will hate it. It takes twice as long to set the cook time since the dial is rather sensitive, so you inevitably overshoot the time you desire & then have to dial back down to the correct time. Furthermore, once the microwave is running, you can't add time, another dumb idea. Also, for very low cook times you cannot set the time in less than 5 second intervals. This isn't that big of a deal, except that I heat up small quantities of baby food & it would be nice to be able to get exactly the temperature I want.

It's a premium model with a premium price tag. There are a lot of presets, it's big inside but has a small footprint, heats quickly and evenly. Heating by timer and power level is great, if you already know your times and temps. The drawbacks others discuss, such as the light that turns off as soon as you open the door (dumb) and the fact that stainless steel is a pain to clean, are true. But my disappointment is that after about a year and a half, the much-vaunted Genius sensor isn't working.<br /><br />I keep our oven pretty clean inside, so it's not a question of obscuring the sensors. But foods like potatoes, which should cook in 6-8 minutes, are now not even alerting me that they're halfway done until 15 minutes pass, and then it recommends another 20 minutes to finish. I let it do it's thing the first time I noticed this and got a dried out-shriveled up Russet after a 30-minute microwave assault. Ouch. Toss that one.<br /><br />So to sum up, the sensor may not last long past the warranty period and it's automated operation is not trustworthy after that.

Hopefully Visa Signature honors their warranty extension policy and fixes this thing for me.<br />The microwave is LOUD. Not just the beeping, but the actual microwaving operation itself sounds like a turboprop starting its takeoff roll. You can hear it being used through walls and doors of your house easily.<br />The interior light operation is comical - it turns on when the microwave is cooking, but does not turn on when the door is opened. If you're trying to balance anything difficult that can be spilled (like my daily bowl of oatmeal) in anything other than an ultra bright room, good luck. You'll get used to cleaning out the microwave.<br />The door hinges are [un]balanced such that the door slowly closes when you open it. Trying to put something into the microwave with two hands?

I went to each site and downloaded their manuals for the 1.2 cubic feet models and decided on which features I liked best. The selling point for the NN-SD681S was the sensor cook features with 14 recipes, sensor reheat feature, and sensor cook feature. The sensor cook feature takes all the guess work out of reheating but this microwave can be used as a traditional microwave by hitting the quick minute button, turning dial for timing in seconds, or selecting power level along with cook time.

There are two things I kinda miss about the old microwave: 1) it had a light when you open the door 2) it beeped to remind you you left something in there.  These two things seem little to me, but the lack of them REALLY bothered my mom. My mom loves the turn dial and uses it the most. It's easier for her, but she never adjusts the heat settings and her food still turns out fine. I tend to use the sensor reheat which usually takes more time than turning the dial to heat up a plate of food. When I do use it though my food is moist and wonderful never dry. Popcorn is hit or miss in this thing we use the mini bags and they pop perfectly when I press the button anything larger scares me as the bag doesn't inflate like a regular microwave until the last second even when I change the size of the bag in the settings.

Yeah you can place mug with handle towards the back but is ridiculous to have to do that.  They should adjust rpm so it does at least a complete rotation on the 30 second marks from initial placement.  Or allow timer setting to be adjusted in finer amounts.  I miss a manual key pad since I used that in past.  Minor issue I know but I boil a lot of water in tall mugs and it gets old having to turn super hot mug around to reach handle when microwave stops.  And in dark.<br />Heating wise this heats even and quick, can't complain there.  I do wish the buttons were back lit.<br /><br />Died today. 1-23-16 Would run a few seconds then shut down.

I turned it off immediately.  Inside the vent on the right side was scorched.  Amazon has it on a 1-month return policy so I was out of luck there.  I spent almost $50 to send it to Panasonic.  Supposedly they will fix it or send me a replacement.  I haven't heard anything yet - - it's only been two weeks.  I don't think I'll get the shipping fees back.  (Note, I could have brought it to a designated repair place but the closest one was about 90 minutes away.)

June 3rd, 2014 3:30 pm finally got a call from Panasonic.  (It was on my to-do list but I had never tried to contact them.)  The Panasonic rep said the warranty was voided because the technician said \\""an arc\\"" was found - - as in they're saying a little piece of metal must have been put in the microwave and are blaming me.  There was no metal.  Frozen spinach in a made-to-be-microwaved bowl that had been used 100's of times before and after this incident with no problems.  Panasonic said they would replace the microwave for about $115 dollars.  Which didn't make us happy.  The Panasonic rep took our complaint to her manager and she just called back in about 10 minutes to say that they would be sending us a refurbished unit as a replacement at no cost.

I got it from amazon and after about 2 months of use the microwave would just randomly stop while you were using it. So you would be cooking something and you would set it for say 2.00 minutes and about 15 seconds it would just stop with no error message. This didn't happen every time but happened enough that it got very annoying. I contacted panasonic because it was too later to return it to amazon. I'm not giving it such a low score because of this. Things break sometimes and thats no reason for 1 start but i will describe my support experience (which is why i gave it 1 star).<br /><br />My experience with panasonic support was one of the worst experiences i have ever had. 1st i live in descent size community (the capital of the state at ~250,000 people). So i'm not in the middle of know where. I can't tell you how many run arounds panasonic gave me. First getting through their automated system to talk to someone was a pain in itself. Then after after getting through i was told that the closest authorized repair show was 1.5 hours away. They wanted me to drive there. 6 hours of driving (once to drop it off and once to pick it up)...NO THANK YOU. They didn't know what to do. So they gave me some BS story about how they are searching for other locations in my area to fix it. OK you already don't know your own service locations? They said they would call me back within 2 days...which of course they NEVER DID. This went on for 3 weeks. I would call and they would say they are still searching and would call me by a specific date and i never received 1 call from them (and yes i talked to more than one manager after getting mad). Finally they asked me to take a picture of the stickers on the inside of my door and to send my amazon receipt to them which i did. So its now at about 5 weeks with an unreliable microwave that always seems to shut off. I called Monday and i was promised everything would be taken care of by Friday (and of course they would call me). Well guess what i had to call the next Monday. They THEN asked me to peel the door stickers off my microwave and mail it to some place on the east cost. I asked why don't you just send me a box and i'll send the entire thing which they would not do. Hmm how likely do you think it is that small sticker would have been lost when Panasonic received it?<br /><br />Thankfully amazon is AWESOME. I called amazon and they said they would take care of it. They sent me a new microwave and the ups driver just had me put the old one in the new box. The new microwave works perfectly and i really like it but just pray you don't EVER had to deal with panasonic support. I don't know what the failure rate of these Microwaves are but it might be a good idea to buy a squaretrade (which are awesome to deal with) warranty rather than dealing with panasonic.of by Friday (and of course they would call me).

I called amazon and they said they would take care of it. They sent me a new microwave and the ups driver just had me put the old one in the new box. The new microwave works perfectly and i really like it but just pray you don't EVER had to deal with panasonic support. I don't know what the failure rate of these Microwaves are but it might be a good idea to buy a squaretrade (which are awesome to deal with) warranty rather than dealing with panasonic.",2014-03-01

The technology, or whatever magic it does, because reheating to a perfect temp with one button is serious magic. There have not been any over-zapped leftovers in two months now from lasagna, to soup to meat - even hamburgers!!<br /><br />I used the sensor cooking the first time the other day for roasted potatoes, which I nuke first then brown in the oven, and it was a better set and forget than my crock-pot. I did everything else I needed while the microwave did its magic. I used baby red potatoes, variety of sizes shapes, etc, didn't do anything but wash, olive oil, salt and pepper. They were cooked evenly and just right. I still did finish in the oven, since it was on, but if it wasn't I would have served them as is.<br /><br />For the price, it's a ridiculously easy to use microwave that saves time, money, and as a work-at-home mom, some nights, even my sanity.",2014-03-01

I don't hear the microwave power up and down like my old oven. The sensor cooking is very useful. I'm using it 90% of the time. With the color LCD touch screen panels getting so cheap.

It would have been nice to select the cooking menu by plain words instead of looking it up in the user's manual.<br /><br />I read some people are complaining the light doesn't come on when the door is opened. That's actually a nice feature. I leave the door open after cooking to let the moistures out and don't have to worry about the ligh being on.<br /><br />There were minor problems. I don't know if it's just mine or on most of the units? The back panel vibrates when on and makes a loud noise. I had to put cardboard between the seam to quiet it down.

Much more powerful than my previous one. Heats up food in about half the time.<br />2.) Compact – fits on my microwave shelf with plenty of room to spare.<br />3.) LED display is clear, bright and simple to understand.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />1.) You set the cooking time with a dial, rather than typing it in on a keypad.<br />2.) Looks nice (looks are subjective, but to me, it’s really no big deal.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.) Unlike my previous one, there’s no light inside when you open the door.<br />1.) My previous one had a handle to open the door, rather than pressing the rectangle on the lower right hand part of the unit. I’m forever absent-mindedly reaching for the handle.<br /><br />One other comment:<br />The instruction manual is longer than the one which came with my PC. I haven’t thoroughly read through all of it, because there’s no way I’m going to use all those ‘features.’ It wouldn’t surprise me, if on page 2,475, there are instructions on how to cure cancer and build a thermonuclear bomb! However, since I have no plans to do either, I don’t need to read “War And Peace” to heat up food.

It is a question of fine tuning the power level and cook time through experience.  It is roomy inside with a large turntable.<br />Now to the negative qualities:  I bought this oven on 3/30/12.  Just over a month after that it began not turning on at times.  It has steadily worsened over time.  I am now searching for a replacement.  Guessing there is a short in something.  I am not a drink or snack machine kicker at all but I have gone from slapping it on the side near the Start button to using a light-weight rubber mallet.<br />I am scared to death that it is going to stop completely any day now, berfore I find that replacement.<br />Other minor negatives:  The door is very hard to close and open.  The interior light does not work during cooking so you can't see whether something is going to boil over, etc., or not.  I dislike the timer knob for setting the timer.  It is hard to determine how fast to turn it.  It takes forever or way over-shoots the desired setting.  And it is loud.<br />Would I buy this same microwave oven again?  Absolutely not!

At first I just set the minutes/power and allowed for the new to me 1200W which did a great job. Then, I put a washed potato(leaving it wet) on a microwave safe plate and covered it with a Nordic Ware MW cover that has six small vents to let steam escape and pushed &#34;Sensor Cook&#34; to start the process. Not trusting it I also started a timer at the same time with six minutes which has worked well with standard non Sensor cooking. The Sensor Cook produced a perfect potato actually in a little less time. Then I tried &#34;Sensor Reheat&#34; on some brisket which was placed on the plate with some sauce and covered it with the NW cover. The reheat was excellent resulting in a moist brisket ready to serve. So, you need to have some moisture on the food and cook/reheat it covered to allow steam to escape for the sensor to read. Cons would be that that I was at first daunted by the new technology and unsure that I would be able to make use of the Sensor functions. Now, I wouldn't want to be without Sensor Cooking as it is not a gimmick, but a real advance in MW cooking. Regards",2014-01-28

It is not very large on the outside for its wattage, with enough clearance below our cupboards that my cats can sit on it.  Nonetheless, there is enough space inside for a very tall travel mug.  It has three ways of setting the time:  a twist knob, a &#34;quick minute&#34; button, and a sensor that senses steam and then adds cooking time after steam is detected. It has a rotating glass base that is probably responsible for its even heating.  I would probably rate it higher if I read all the directions and if I'd had it long enough to assess its lifespan.

Then the light bulb burnt out. less than 3 weeks. I looked all over for the typical two phillips-head screws to open the light door, Couldn't find it. Looked at user's manual. No mention of a light. Looked at Amazon: only mention was that light doesn't go on when door is opened, only when cooking (hadn't noticed). Tried the panasonic online customer service web chat. Had to enter product category, no category for microwaves (hmmm?). Finally called customer service (what is this? 1955?) THEN I was told I could take my 3 week old microwave to a repair shop to have the light bulb changed (this sounds like the horror stories of government wasteful spending). Not happening.

I like the rotary dial for setting the time and other options.  Once you get some experience it's pretty quick.  I like the add a minute button too for convenience.<br /><br />INVERTER:  The best feature is the Inverter low power heating function.  Most microwaves attempt low power cooking by cycling on and off high (normal) power and off, for example, 10 sec on and 10 sec off for 50%.  Not so with this fellow.  It has some magical technology that can scale the power down and actually heat at low power.  This produces much better results when you need low power, like melting/softening dairy products.  I tried several of the %s and I never detected that the microwave was switching off and on.<br /><br />NOISE:  I debated knocking down 1 star due to noise.  I would like to give it 4.5 but ended up rounding up to 5.  IT IS LOUD.  However, I forgive the noise for the other nice features.<br /><br />SIZE:  The right side where the microwave element is really is narrower than most units which means the outside dimensions are smaller compared to other units with the same interior dimensions.  It also really is lighter.  It replaces an old Sharp with about the same interior dimensions and it feels much lighter than the old Sharp.<br /><br />POWER:  When cooking on regular high power the 1200W is plenty of wattage to cook food quickly.<br /><br />DISPLAY:  I read some reviews about some Panasonics that had displays that were hard to read or dim.  This unit's display is bright blue and easy to read.<br /><br />POWER II:  Does anyone really need to have 10 power settings?  I can't think of a time when 60-90% was needed instead of 50 or 100% adjusting for the time.  It seems like the only useful power levels are 20, 30, 50 & 100%.  Am I wrong?  This seems like an easy way to simplify the UI design.  Am I wrong?  Please comment.  It is absolutely absurd to think that there is a situation where you need to have 90% power and 100% just won't work.",2014-01-11

The microwave arrived promptly on 2 Jan as it said it would. I was very pleased - Amazon Prime thank you!<br /><br />I bought it because it had the power (1200 watts) I wanted although the capacity was bigger and more functions than I really wanted. Manufacturers - please note that many people just want a powerful (so that it heats quickly), compact oven (without taking up too much countertop space) with an intuitive pad that is efficient.<br /><br />I am very disappointed with the oven. Just before I moved here, I was using a Samsung with which I was very pleased. It was compact, solid, powerful and it had the wonderful function where it starts when I press the 'Start' button.<br /><br />I expected to find the same qualities but that was not the case.<br /><br />1. The oven felt 'hollow' and the metal felt and looked cheap, and not compact at all.<br /><br />2.There was no light (isn't that a basic feature?). It was hard to tell whether the mug of water or soup was boiling yet or now. I had to stop the oven to check. This is annoying and waste of time when one is busy with a relocation. However, the light came on today. Which means it is not functioning properly, and could go off again.<br /><br />3. The operating pad is not intuitive at all. The last couple of ovens I had - we move to a different country once every 2 years and were living in Singapore, Belgium and the UK the past 6 years - were intuitive and had the 30-sec express button. So I assumed it was a normal feature. It is not.<br /><br />I have to press one button to set the time and then press start. I probably have to press the power button too but haven't figured that out with all that's going on with the move.<br /><br />To put heat a mug of water, I would press the Quick Minute button (that took me a while to figure out bec it was on the Inverter function row and assumed it was for the Inverter function [whatever that is] but it got the oven working so that's what I've been using. Quick Minute = 1 minute.<br /><br />4. The More/Less button didn't work. I couldn't adjust the cooking time and so had to hit another Quick Minute if I wanted more than one minute. With this power, 20 or 30 secs makes all the difference. So, often I have to stand there and switch off after 40 seconds or press Quick Minute twice and then wait at the oven to switch off when it has heated for 1 minute and 20 secs or 1 minute and 40 secs. Annoying!<br /><br />5. I found that at the same volume (1 mug e.g.) of same temperature of tap water, it would sometimes boil at one minute (the Quick Minute button pressed once) and other times it would just be lukewarm. This uncertainty is very aggravating because I can't just input the time and continue what I was doing and then come back to a bowl of heated soup or mug of water ready to dip in my tea bag. I have to often put in my finger to check if it is hot enough or not.<br /><br />And if it is not, and I need another 20 or 30 secs, I had to hit the Quick Minute and switch off at 30 secs.<br /><br />In this hi-tech automated age, this is not acceptable.<br /><br />I have been using a microwave oven for over 20 years now. This is my second Panasonic - the first was the first generation of Genius back in the 1980s. But through the years we got a new oven each time we moved to a new country and I've not had problems like these.<br /><br />I'd like to return it but don't know how as I've never bought an appliance on Amazon before - always bought it in the store where I can see and touch to see if I like the functions. Because I don't have a car here, Amazon is a great way to shop. It's probably past the return date and the box has been removed by the movers.<br /><br />I hate the oven.

I was concerned because out of all the reviews I've read, I was amazed to see that the quality/longevity of many microwave ovens these days is not as seemingly good as it was years ago. We had a microwave for about 10 years. And it was a used microwave. Which means that it was used. And long before us, too! So, once it caught on fire, I researched around a lot. Many microwaves don't last the year. And then returning it or trying to get it fixed/warrantied is madness/not happening. Many of these microwaves were priced about $100 and closer to $200. And they take up a lot of room.  And they look ugly as hell.  For something that takes up this much space and for the price, I want something that works for more than just a year. In fact, I want it to work for at least 5 years, but hopefully more. For a microwave, the Panasonic NN-SD681S does the trick. It's attractive for a microwave and it doesn't stand out like a sore thumb. And it works. And I didn't feel like I was being killed on the price.",2014-01-04

Excited. Read many reviews before purchase and was eager to confirm pros and cons.<br /><br />NEW info I didn't pick up in others' review:<br />- CONSTANT BUZZ - As long as the microwave is PLUGGED IN, it produces a buzzing sound. It sounds about the same as an old florescent light buzz in sound quality and volume. It was a bit annoying to me... I thought it was just my ears were sensitive. Then my wife walked in to the kitchen and said, \\""what is that buzzing sound?\\"" while she was still a good 6~8 feet away. Not just me. =)  It's not enough for me to return this microwave... but this will tempt me to retire it earlier. Minus 1 star because of the buzz.<br /><br />Common reviewed points:<br />-  Dial - it will take a bit to get use to. Real test will be when I have grease fingers and try to use this knob dial. [can't use non-greased knuckles to press number buttons like I used to.]<br /><br />- Over light - fine. dim, but not bad.<br /><br />- Button display hard to read - I'm in my 30s. I CAN read it, but have to admit, none of the button display jumped out at a quick glance.  The shiny, pretty stainless steal plate where the black display text is printed on makes the text harder to read.  Its 2 sides of the same coin... you want shiny pretty microwave? you get harder to read button text. It's fine. I'll eventually memorize where the buttons are.<br /><br />- WIFI drops when microwave is operating - my most feared item.... tested it. got iphone 5, netgear r6300 dual band router, Panasonic smart tv running Netflix next room, laptop in kitchen on Netflix, a desktop (via wifi) running youtube down the hall.  All connected at 5.0GHz frequency. All running fine for 3 min of continuous microwaving. Phew~ so not an issue at all, if you have similar tech setup.<br /><br />Update:<br />After about 2 weeks of use, the buzzing noise got to us. We find ourselves unplugging the microwave to kill the buzz. This is cumbersome. Downgrading to 2 star...",2014-01-04

My wife and I figured we'd go without replacing it, that maybe it wasn't so necessary to have one after all.<br />But recently we were thinking that we should get another microwave, since it comes in so handy for certain things. But we were worried because our previous one was an old machine, and they don't build things the way they used to. It was a monster, built to last, and we know that new products (no matter what item you're talking about) are basically disposable, not as well-made as in the past.<br />We were researching brands, looking at ratings, etc. It took us a while to settle on this make and model. It's been about a month since we received it, and so far, so good. It works very well, and we're very happy with its performance. Hopefully, as we get more into it and use it for more advanced cooking, it will continue to satisfy us.

I gave up and took the cover off.  The problem is that the stiffness of the bracket that holds the door latch and switch is insufficient and the bracket deflection and slop in the latch/switch mounting holes allow the door the close and the switch not be made which means the oven will not turn on.<br /><br />Being an engineer I was able to jerry-rig something to provide some additional stiffness but I still have to open up the oven about once every six weeks to readjust the latch mounting to keep it working.<br /><br />So good oven for the first 30 days - after that you are totally on your own.,2014-01-02

It was ordered on sale at Best Buy, and arrived earlier than expected, so I've used it daily for nearly three weeks. It's fast, so I shorten most cook times about a minute or less. You can easily add or subtract minutes or seconds to meet your needs. I've used the melt button to melt chocolate for a glaze as well as to soften butter for my holiday table.<br /><br />I found I have to reduce popcorn cooking time by 30 seconds to pop to perfection albeit, only a few kernels were slightly singed when following the package directions. In my new microwave enthusiasm, I ordered the Microwave Pasta Boat from Amazon, a $7 ($6.95 to be precise), and now make no muss, no fuss pasta dishes easily (I shortened the cook time by 1 minute, and my wheat pasta turned out perfectly).<br /><br />Cleaning the stainless steel also is easy. After each use, I just put a little white vinegar on a microfiber cloth and wipe, going with the grain. I also have no problem with the light going off when the door is open as I like to leave the door open for a bit after cooking to eliminate odors.<br /><br />The only other objection I found in the Amazon reviews is that some units die after little use. Bearing that in mind, I also sprung about $20 for four-year protection, which is transferable on the off chance that I ever decide to sell it. All in all, this is a perfect microwave, and I highly recommend paying the extra for its many time-saving features if you're in the market for a new microwave.",2013-12-29

I replaced the previous two when I updated my kitchen to the stainless steel look. I sold one for a small amount and gave one away after 12 yrs. of use including the one that I had repaired. The current set have been working perfectly for approximately 9 yrs. I find this amazing. Each of the 5 microwaves have worked flawlessly for about 10 plus years and with the exception of the 1 repair all were still functioning. They seem to never die. I wish I could this kind of use from my other purchases. F.Y.I. The first Panny microwave was a rotary dial unit bought about 26 years or so ago. I sold/gave that one away about 22 years ago to upgrade to the two push button units that I used continuously until I replaced them with the stainless ones.

It's rather large, seems to heat well, and looks nice with it's stainless exterior and blue LCD, although it's extremely hard to read the black text on stainless that labels each button.<br /><br />The problem is the knob.<br /><br />In the old days, microwaves also had a knob, but they also had a scale printed next to the knob. You could see directly what the scale was, and turn the knob to the direct value that you wanted. Done.<br /><br />With THIS microwave, you don't get to know what the scale is. At some point, it switches from 5 seconds, to 15 seconds, to 30 seconds, to minutes, etc. So when you get the microwave, you turn the knob with the expectation that the timer is going to be set in a linear fashion. Nope. You'll get some random number that invariably is an overshoot of the time value you wanted.<br /><br />Why is it so hard to build microwaves with an interface that humans can comfortably use? We used to have timer knobs, but we took those away and put on keypads. The keypads were okay, but then we had to mess with keypads and demand that you press something like \\""Time Cook\\"" to actually enter a time. Isn't what most people do with a microwave \\""time cook\\""? Why do I need to specify that directly? I digress. Then we took the keypads away and we're back to timer knobs but they're worse!

We've been using this for a few months now, and I am beyond thrilled with how huge of an improvement this microwave is over our previous LG microwave of nearly the same size.<br /><br />First of all, I was unsure of how much I'd like or dislike using the dial to set the time, as I've always had microwaves with individual numbers on a keypad. This worry was immediately assuaged the moment I used it for the first time. The dial makes it INCREDIBLY easy to set the time, whether you want to set it for 5 seconds or 5 minutes. You just turn the dial left or right to increase or decrease the time. Some previous reviews seem to think that the dial was overly sensitive; I did not share this sentiment. I felt like it was just right. You can turn it fast to instantly skip up to a couple minutes in time, or turn it slower and have complete control. Panasonic did an excellent job with the sensitivity and adjustment through this dial. In fact, it's probably my favorite &#34;new&#34; feature of this entire microwave.<br /><br />Furthermore, the &#34;inverter&#34; technology is great, and it allows this Microwave to do things that my previous &#34;smart&#34; microwaves were unable to do. We constantly reheat meals for dinner the next night, and all we have to do is press &#34;sensor reheat&#34; and then the start button. The microwave does the rest of the work for us. No figuring out times, opening it, checking it, putting it in for a few more seconds, etc. I'm not going to pretend to know the in-and-out of what kind of sensors or technology the microwave is using to determine it, but this function ALWAYS results in our food being reheated to the perfect temperature, without ever overcooking it in the process of trying to warm it back up.<br /><br />The inverter function always helps with lower power applications like melting chocolate, softening butter, etc. You can rely on the sensor to handle this for you, the inside of the microwave door shows you which setting to push for each of these tasks. We've tried almost all of them, and never once had anything come out to less than optimal temp/melt/softening. Makes this appliance indispensable for baking and cooking purposes. No more trying to melt chocolate chips over a steam bath on the stove top!<br /><br />Appearance wise, this microwave is also a winner. The bright blue LED lighting on the display is very easy to read, even from across the kitchen. The stainless finish of the microwave is excellent as well, and combined with the control panel design, very modern looking.<br /><br />And lastly, to focus on peoples main use for this, the full power cooking is excellent too. Being 1200W versus our old 1100W LG microwave, I wasn't expecting much of a difference in power or cooking speed. But at full power, this microwave cooks noticeably quicker than our older 1100W microwave did; very happy with the decrease in needed time that we've seen. And furthermore, it is significantly less quiet while cooking than other microwaves I've owned in the past.<br /><br />All in all, zero complaints over the first few months, I'd have no problems whatsoever recommending this model to anyone in the future. I'll keep this updated over time if I have any other thoughts, or if we have any issues with reliability, but right now it's perfect. Let me know in the comments section if you have any questions or want me to address anything else, and I'll respond as quickly as possible.g butter, etc. You can rely on the sensor to handle this for you, the inside of the microwave door shows you which setting to push for each of these tasks.

Performance has been reliable and the unit is simple to use. The \\""sensing\\"" capability accurately reads when food is properly cooked or re-heated so food gets evenly and thoroughly heated without being overdone. For setting yourself, there are 10 levels of power and an open wide range of time choices with lots of shortcuts for specific foods. (The instruction manual is very helpful here.) The \\""recipe\\"" feature is handy in logging one power/time setting that can be used over and over again for routine tasks (but allows for only a single repeatable recipe at a time until changed to another.)<br /><br />Know that that the unit's interior light comes on only during heating operations. This means food is illuminated AS it cooks, but then plunged into darkness when cooking stops and you just might want to see how it went. This is a minor inconvenience but one that cost this review a full 5-star rating. (With some microwaves, the interior light also comes on whenever the door is opened making it easy to pre-position food ahead and clearly see the result after heating without having to take the container out.)<br /><br />Also the brushed stainless front tends to show every spot of grease, every fingerprint, and wants cleaning attention. But that's what you get with stainless, and not a product fault.<br /><br />Overall, a well-engineered cooking and heating tool with quality performance.",2013-12-19

The controls will likely seem idiosyncratic at first, but the oven is as easy to use as any other oven that I have owned. Power is very ample--you might find that some ready-to-cook items require less cooking time than is recommended on package labels. I haven't had to test Panasonic's customer service.<br /><br />Many reviewers have noted that the oven light does not turn on when the door is open.

Well you put ur food in the microwave and press inverter/rewarm what this dose it automaticaly rewarms you food well measuring the temp of the steam that comes of the food to know when its done It makes your food perfect 95% of the time (occasional isses with soups but all you have to do it hit rewarm again and then its good<br /><br />I will never buy another microwave that dosent have that feature.",2013-12-18

I thought not having a light when opened would be a hardship, but it hasn't because the white interior bounces around light from the kitchen.<br /><br />  There is a noticeable difference when melting butter or thawing frozen goods on the evenness of the heating.  I step down the power level about 50% of the time. I click power level first, then spin the dial for the time I want. For instance, on weekends I like to make hashbrowns with green peppers and onions. I keep frozen stir fry peppers and onions, plus frozen hashbrowns, and unfreeze them in here while the skillet heats up. I drain the liquid and plop into the hot skillet. The frying time is less and there isn't all that ice water to fight.<br /><br />  I freeze shredded cheese too, and sometimes I use up the old bag; I can pull out a frozen bag, place a handful of ice cheese on a paper plate, set it on 30%, and in a minute or so have only cold cheese, neither ice nor melted. With my old microwave, I'd have a lot of ice and a few cheese puddles.<br /><br />  It is very classing-looking for the money.

In defense of the product we have a toddler that slams the door shut pretty hard if you don't close it fast enough - something I shared with Panasonic. They do consider it to be a warranty repair. The problem is that depending on where you live it may not be practical to get warranty service. I live in the Washington DC suburbs of Northern Virginia. The closest service center Panasonic has is in Fredericksburg - which likely means 6 or more hours of travel time for two round trips for a repair and potentially much longer if traffic is bad. Not worth it for the cost of this appliance. When I called customer support they promised that they would find a closer service center for me once I sent proof of purchase. That was done on Nov 21 and I called back on Dec 4 after hearing nothing back on my case number. The response was still  take it to Fredericksburg but they'll elevate it - call back on Dec 6. Their automated menu system is terrible - it took me 10 minutes to trick it into giving me a human operator and end to end it took 25 minutes of phone time. The service rep was very nice, but had no idea why nobody ever got back to me and couldn't help me any further. I was hoping they could ship a replacement door or have some other way to easily replace this broken plastic latch.<br /><br />Not sure that other brands have closer repair centers or better repair options - just something to keep in mind.<br /><br />Followup.<br /><br />Never heard back from Panasonic so called back again on Dec 12.

This one seemed to have advanced features and nicer appearance for only a bit more money.  Here's why I splurged, and why I shouldn't have:<br /><br />The old one (similar to the current NN-SN661S) looked slightly dated, had a plastic keypad, a decade-old digital display and minimal features.  The NN-SD681S had 50 watts less power but a stainless steel face, bright blue lights, a more graphical display, a knob instead of a keypad and brand new features: Keep Warm, Melt & Soften, and Recipe Store.  Pretty nifty, eh?<br /><br />Then the &#34;uh-oh&#34; moments:<br /><br />1) Unlike the former plastic, the stainless face shows fingerprints far more brightly.<br />2) The bright neon-blue lights illuminate the entire kitchen at night.  My kitchen view of the city lights is now filtered through a blue haze until I cover the microwave.<br />3) The knob advances the cook time in progressive increments, growing from one second to thirty as you crank it higher.  At 1200 watts I often need short precise times, but after 10 seconds the knob advances by fives (The 13, 17, & 23 second times I used to punch into my old keypad are now impossible.<br />4) The &#34;new&#34; features turn out to be mostly time presets raised to dedicated button status (like &#34;Popcorn&#34;).  Keep Warm and Melt & Soften are little more than defrost presets that require you to enter the weight of target item.  You don't need two more buttons for that.  The Delay Start has a 5 minute maximum delay.  The Recipe Store feature merely allows you to repeat your last time & power level setting.

After reading many reviews, I went ahead with the purchase as I felt the good points outweighed the bad.  I had to wait many weeks for the microwave to be shipped as it was out of stock.  Three months after receiving the microwave, it smelled of burnt wires and emitted a small amount of smoke.  After contacting customer service I was instructed to drive the microwave 1-1/2 hours away for servicing in Centralia, Illinois.  I advised the CS person that since the microwave was under warranty I did not feel I should be out the time nor money to get service for what was apparently a manufacturing flaw.  I did not receive any satisfaction as the CS agent did not offer any other solution.  I felt that it did not make financial sense to invest the time and money to take the microwave in for servicing only to have to make the trip a second time to pick it up.  Tonight the microwave has finally died!  Prior to this it was not unusual to have to repeat the start-up process 5-6 times before the microwave would start.<br /><br />This is the first time in 30 years that I have ever had problems with a microwave!<br /><br />I will be purchasing a new microwave tomorrow and it will not be Panasonic.  It is unfortunate as I have many other Panasonic items and have never had issues.  I could have dealt with the issues had the customer service backed up their product, but when you have a warranty and customer service that is less than acceptable, it is a definite deterrent from wanting to buy from that company again.<br /><br />I am glad that the microwave has finally gone out as it was extremely frustrating to have to try and try several times before it would start up.  I would not buy this type of microwave again.  I am disappointed with the customer service and am disappointed with the technology that failed to impress me, but was successful in frustrating me!",2013-11-25

We selected this one for the high ratings on this and other sites, but it has some surprising omissions that make it appear less convenient than the old one, at least so far.<br /><br />First of all, the light inside only functions while the microwave is working. As soon as the cooking cycle ends, the light goes out and stays out, even when the door is opened. This makes it hard to see whether the food is properly cooked and even harder to see when the microwave requires spot cleaning. A particularly frustrating deficiency. There is no lighting on the control area, apart from the display at the top, and the small black lettering on silver is very difficult to make out in dim light so you pretty much have to memorize the placement of the buttons. Finally, the timer function seems really odd. It doesn't work if the microwave is in use, so you can't, say, nuke some vegetables while timing a baking job in the toaster oven. Also, it offers only a brief and quiet series of beeps when it finishes, which is difficult to hear even from across the room. There's no further indication of a finished timing cycle. The beep doesn't recur and the display simply resets. A minor point if you have another timer, but annoying if you're used to a microwave that handles both easily and lets you know what's going on. Basically, the timer is useless, at least for us.<br /><br />The overall appearance is quite pleasing in a boxy way and, surprisingly, the &#34;metal&#34; façade is actually metal. Magnets stick, etc., which is nice. It took a while to get used to the dial time setting feature, but it may have some advantages. I'm a bit suspicious of the analog nature of the controls, which could be harder to keep clean over time if food particles get inside. I'm used to a seamless plastic covered touch pad, but I haven't had it long enough to comment on that aspect.",2013-11-19

Overall we are thrilled with the unit and highly recommend it.<br /><br />UPDATE: microwave just completely died 2 years and 4 months after purchase. Because we purchased on Amazon there is no warranty and Panasonic will not cover it. Another reason why for appliances Costco is so compelling. If I had bought my microwave there I would be on my way to an exchange right now (with costs transferred to manufacturer by Costco).

Our last GE one quit working with a keypad error at 13 months, so we had to get another one. I liked that this one doesn't have the touch key pad at all. It has regular buttons and a knob to change to time amount. It's really a lot easier to dial in the time then pressing a half dozen buttons on a key pad every time. I don't know why more companies don't use this setup. My wife and I both like it, and it works fine so far. The only this I miss is that it doesn't have a 30sec button. The &#34;stainless steel&#34; is really just a thin metal trim panel around the glass and buttons. The rest of it is just silver painted plastic.<br /><br />Just got it, so I only have a couple of things to mention at this point. If it still works well is a year or so, maybe I will come back and update this review to 5 stars. For now, 4 stars for any cheap appliance that is likely to quit before I want it to is plenty.<br /><br />BTW, right after this arrived, the GE unit started working again...so now we have a backup microwave. Apparently, steam from boiling water underneath it (we have the microwave mounted over the stove) gets into the touchpad and shorts it out. (Of course, the part was almost as much as the whole microwave!) I read that some people were able to dry it with a hair dryer or heat gun. I tried and it did not work for me, but just letting it sit around for a few days seemed to to the trick. So, it you are replacing your unit due to a touchpad short error, keep that in mind....or just get the panasonic one with the knob instead of a touchpad.<br /><br />UPDATE: 11/16/14<br />Still works  good,  no problems. One thing weird  is that  if you use the timer, you can't  use the microwave. I've heard that  other microwaves  are the same. Whatever, I just use my smart phone if I need a timer.<br /><br />UPDATE: 4/27/17<br />Still works fine.

It has to be slammed shut to get it to work.<br />I took it apart to see if I could do anything to fix it and found that the reason it has this problem is due to the flimsy piece of metal that the door switch mechanism is attached to. When you push the door shut, it pushes on this mechanism, which then bends the flimsy metal. When that piece of metal gets bent so far without being able to spring back into its original position, the switch mechanism is unable to activate the micro switch that lets the unit know that the door is closed properly. As a result, the unit will not start cooking.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have been unable to find a good way to strengthen this piece of metal due to the way it is situated in the unit. If Panasonic had maybe put a second metal bracket on the opposite side of the switch mechanism, it would be more sturdy and would not have this problem.<br /><br />It's a shame because this microwave works great otherwise.

I'm still very happy with the automated cook and reheat modes. I never have to punch in cook times. When I have to use a microwave somewhere else, it's so terribly confusing.<br />I will report the one build problem that sometimes the latch on the door doesn't hook right and the microwave doesn't start correctly. You have to wiggle the door a bit and then it starts. This doesn't seem to be a degradation over time problem as it's been happening since got it.<br />Otherwise, this is still a great model.<br />ORIGINAL:<br />I'm kind of amazed by this thing. Granted, my last two microwaves have not been that impressive, but the unit really is a miracle of modern technology. The Sensor Cook and Sensor Reheat buttons consistently work and I really didn't expect that. Okay, last night my home-made veggie soup didn't properly reheat so it's possible that very liquid things aren't that great. However, in general, the automated sensor modes make guessing at the right length of time a thing of the past. Hot pockets, pot pies, left over lasagna, leftover pasta, it's all worked perfectly (just not the soup which turned out tepid). It's very nice.<br />There are some flaws with this microwave. I think some other reviewers have pointed out the display. It can be hard to see those buttons when it's a bit dark. Lighting up the control panel would be an excellent improvement.<br />Also, the interface could be a bit better. This microwave has more modes and settings than some smartphones. The directions aren't terrible, but there's just too much to understand. We restrict ourselves to the Sensor Cook and Reheat (there is a nifty reference chart inside the door with all the key setting levels. Melt and defrost work well as well, but we haven't had much occasion to use them. Surprisingly, the dial control doesn't bother me at all. It's really well-designed and spinning it to set a time or a number isn't the problem I suspected it would be.<br />Several reviewers mention the fact the light doesn't turn on when you open the microwave. It's a fair point, but the interior space is so large this isn't really a problem (unless you are microwaving in a very dim room and then you won't be able to see the controls!) I haven't had any issues with it, though my kitchen is well lit.<br />The microwave also fits in with the brush steel look of my kitchen. It's well-made and very solid. No complaints as to build quality.<br />So far, I highly recommend this unit to anyone. In comparison to my last microwaves, it's quite large, so be warned in that respect. I've only had it for a short time though. I'll report back if there are problems after the first year. You can wait for my report or just go buy it.ewers mention the fact the light doesn't turn on when you open the microwave.

Liked the stainless, so looked for another. The Panasonic \\""Inverter\\"" style seemed good, and it works as described; it really does improve reheating and the \\""keep warm\\"" function is great.<br /><br />However,I consider it a major oversight that the interior light doesn't go on except when the oven is in use. I don't really need to see my food turning in circles, but I DO need light when I want to stir the food or clean the interior; in either case, I need to use a flashlight. This is the first microwave I've ever had or seen that does not have an interior light go on when you open the door. To me, a major inconvenience. My own fault; I should have read the reviews and not relied on company reputation.<br /><br />The door: it can be opened only by pressing on large button made for that purpose. No handle on the door means that if the door button connection somehow breaks, you can't open the door and you now have a microwave that you can look at but not use. A design flaw, at best; poor design at worst.<br /><br />The finish on my old GE was high gloss and finger prints wiped away with a simple microfiber towel: this is brushed aluminum that shows up every touch and is difficult to clean well, even with stainless steel polish.<br /><br />Frankly, I would have returned the unit, but the expense wasn't worth it. Would I buy another Panasonic? No. Would I recommend this to a friend? Not if I wanted to keep him/her as such.<br /><br />Conclusion: the inverter feature is nice, but not ground-breaking technology, and not worth the high ticket price for what is a now basic technology item. I still can't believe that the inside has no light when you open the door and that you need a flashlight to clean the interior. We're talking about a switch hookup to the door; that's all. (What? Another 7-cents would have blown the profit margin?). The lack of a door handle is just sheer cheapness or design oversight. Last, but not least, is that it's almost impossible to keep this brushed finish looking clean and nice. Do yourself a favor (as I should have) and buy one of many other brands with the same capacity at a lesser price.

This typically happens when you have a smaller amount of food being heated.  On one occasion there was even a ball of flame in the microwave before this happened, and today it shut down the whole house circuit.<br /><br />It has become very frustrating, and since this was a replacement for an over the stove microwave that we replaced with a hood, my wife won't let me hear the end of it.  I understand that sometimes there are defective products, but when I try to get support from Panasonic the best thing they can offer is to take it to the nearest service center and have them look at it to see if it can be fixed or must be replaced.  Since microwaves are used so frequently nowadays, especially with a few kids, this is a very inconvenient option.  Having had a recent great experience with a Cuisinart toaster oven, where without even asking they sent us a replacement in a couple of days and had us send back the original in the box, I am very disappointed Panasonic won't offer the same service.<br /><br />The functionality of the microwave is fine, but there are several improvements that could be made.  I don't mind it not having a light when the door is open.  I have never had a problem seeing my food well enough.  One thing I was hoping is that it would cook more evenly, but like our last microwave, the center never heats as well as the edges.  This seems to be inherent to microwave technology and the rotating turntable doesn't help with the center.  It is faster than our old microwave.  Things that could be improved include:<br /><br />- Have a 30 second button in addition to the minute button and enable it to add to the current time<br />- Make the done signal for both cooking and the timer louder and have it repeat a few times.<br />- Have a setting for auto heating a cup of coffee or tea - one of the most common uses yet no option for this.<br />- Display the actual names of items when setting sensor cook instead of relying on meaningless numbers.<br />- Vary the size of shape of buttons and make them more readable for improved usability.auto heating a cup of coffee or tea - one of the most common uses yet no option for this.<br />- Display the actual names of items when setting sensor cook instead of relying on meaningless numbers.<br />- Vary the size of shape of buttons and make them more readable for improved usability.",2013-07-24

This really<br />makes the difference in some dishes. The most important<br />one for us was the Indian \\""chai\\"".

At all other places the peak leakage<br />seems to be below 3mw/cm^2 . If you are measuring the leakage, please make<br />sure to measure leakage in all directions.

My wife is sort of technophobic, still she loves this microwave. I do too.<br /><br />In fact, since we own 2 microwaves and our other one is not working well, I just bought a second Panasonic NN-SD681S.<br /><br />If you don't adapt well to 'different' this probably is not for you. But the differences between this and 'normal' microwaves are almost all positive. Not the light going out when you open it, however.<br /><br />I should mention that I bought this 2 weeks ago to replace a Frigidaire microwave that lasted less than a year. I only hope the Panasonic has better staying power.<br /><br />First off, this microwave feels better-made than any other microwave we've owned (about 5 or 6 by now). It's sturdy, the door opens and closes with a feeling of solidity and smoothness and proper fit.<br /><br />The dial is a very interesting difference. No dedicated 1-minute, 2-minute, etc., buttons. But the dial will get you there with little effort. Because it's different, it takes getting used to however.<br /><br />Still it's very well designed: it starts at units of seconds and once you've turned up to 10, it then graduates by 5 second units; and then by 10 second units, and eventually 15 second units. I.e. the dial is actually very sensitive. And turning a single potentiometer turns out to be very user-friendly, compared to having to poke membrane buttons to set, say, 2 minutes 50 seconds, if that's what you want.<br /><br />There is a dedicated button called Quick Min. If you want a minute or 2 or 3 it's very useful. You have to keep pressing it to get to 5 or 6 minutes, however, and we are finding the dial to be just as easy if we need that much time. Quick Min is still very useful for shorter times.<br /><br />The Inverter technology is the real knockout here. If you think about it, using a normal microwave at Power Level 3 is pretty crude. It just shuts off the microwaving for 70% of the time. With the Inverter, you microwave the whole time, but much more gently. In other words, defrosting with the Panasonic is a whole different thing. The first time I used the Turbo Inverter Defrost I was really pleasantly surprised at how perfectly it defrosted some frozen chicken.<br /><br />We have never used a microwave to actually \\""cook\\"" anything.

Its levels seem inconsistent.  One of my main uses is my morning oatmeal, which according to the oatmeal box should take 3 minutes on High.  With 1 cup of liquid (and oatmeal) in a 1 quart container, it invariably boils over, creating a mess.  I finally tinkered with the recipe:  4 minutes on Level 6, followed by 3 minutes on Level 4 - completely different from the recommended cooking.<br /><br />Reheating also tends to boil over, and I've been afraid to try other microwave-defined recipes, convinced that they will overcook.<br /><br />Other notes:  it feels cheaply made (likes to tip when opening the door, which is very lightweight.)  And as others have stated, the interior light is totally useless.  You can't see inside when something is cooking,even tho that is when the light is on.<br /><br />I would not buy this again, and may well replace it soon, despite the fact that it is relatively new and technically works.",2013-05-18

Since I only run it minutes a day I'd rather have performance over quietness as long as I can still hear the TV.  I'm extremely thankful that,  when the food is done, it doesn't keep beeping every few minutes like the Kenmores do.  While it's urgent to get food out of a hot oven, most foods benefit from sitting around in the microwave for a while after cooking and cups of hot water I would like to get out of my discretion or leave in the microwave indefinitely without being nagged by periodic beeps.",2013-05-17

I've used various brands since then, but after the last microwave died in 5 years time, went searching for another Panasonic.<br /><br />After hours searching for a modern microwave, this was the closest that still had some resemblance of earlier microwaves. It has buttons for features and a rotary dial.<br /><br />But what has amazed me about this microwave is that it really can cook evenly. Put it through a tough test: baking a Bundt cake. Mixed a Duncan Hines Classic chocolate cake, put it in a silicone Bundt pan, and cooked it on 10 for 6 minutes (tough test, no fancy sensor cooking). Took it out, pressed it out while hot even (a no-no, but this was a tough test) it didn't fall apart. The cake was thoroughly cooked as if in a convection oven, and unlike regular ovens, deliciously moist -- with zero hard edges. It didn't dry out and crumble the next day. It didn't come out like dense rubber. It had a light crumb, moist and no one could tell it wasn't baked. For chocolate deserts (that won't show it wasn't browned mind you) there wasn't any difference between an oven bake and microwave &#34;bake&#34;, yet the microwave bake was more moist with a finer crumb...and only in 6 minutes for a thick bundt cake!<br /><br />Can imagine how this microwave can cook other time consuming dishes with a little experimentation. So for college students and guys in studio apartments, you don't have to miss out even on baking. And no you don't have to be mom to get it &#34;just right&#34; either. Just follow the baking instructions on the box, put it in these newer fangled silicon baking pans, and there you go, quick, moist and tasty food.<br /><br />Tested it on hot dogs as well. Usually when cooking them in microwaves they will turn out like rubber and hard at the ends. Tested them on two major brands of hot dogs, and they came out plump, and again, moist. It looked like they were slow roasted, with fine moist beads of water on top. Potatoes came out fine and not dry, too.<br /><br />This oven is like a steamer. It cooks from the moisture of the food itself at a rate that doesn't evaporate the moisture, either. So baking, cooking meats and vegetables all come out cooked, not dry or hard even if you don't use the sensor cooking feature.<br /><br />The reason for the 4 star rating and not 5 isn't because of the cooking. It's due to the complexity of the oven itself. For what most people use microwaves for (ease of cooking or a replacement for a stove) I found half the features the dial is used for isn't even needed. It's complicated for complicated sake.<br /><br />Other than that nitpick, the product does as advertised...cooks evenly, fast and the food is moist. It's much more than a simple microwave and extremely glad to have bought this product. Will have fun experimenting with what other traditional &#34;bake only&#34; dishes that can be cooked in it. Anything to not have to wait 45+ minutes to cook a family meal!<br /><br />*** Update: June 2015. ***<br /><br />Still works as new! No problems (cosmetic or structural) occurred.<br /><br />*** Update: a year later in 2014. ***<br /><br />Microwave is still working and used everyday.<br /><br />Amazing thing we discovered is the adjustment of the temperature is so precise we can even make coddled eggs (or over medium) to the perfection just before fully cooked! When people think of cooking eggs in a microwave the image that comes to mind is scrambled rubber -- not with this microwave. At 50% power your eggs can be finished before buttering toast and pouring a cup of coffee. Delicious and very moist like expected with frying (and with the silicon bake ware no need for even PAM). Will test it later this month with cooking eggs for the seasonal potato salad (this microwave can cook eggs to the point no sulfur forms -- a problem with boiling eggs even aminute too long -- so it has saved days a year of time of boiling water in itself).<br /><br />We also tested this microwave with the following (this is helpful for those those situations where a stove isn't available too -- YMMV, due to humidity and climate -- adjust accordingly):<br /><br />A. Cooking various rice varieties works almost as fine as a rice cooker, but in 1/4 of the time. Jasmine rice is perfect for microwave cooking, and we tested it with w-a-y over 20lbs of it (but never cook/rewarm Japanese rice in a microwave to mimic a rice steamer. It'll never compare to steamed rice in a dedicated cooker due to it's very high starch content that needs moisture all the time, or it'll dry out and/or scorch). Cooks almost exactly like on a stove or rice cooker, just make sure there's room for almost 2&#34; of water over the rice to boil it (need more than rice steamers as the water will evaporate quicker). A typical 8oz coffee cup of uncooked rice in like a 2 1/2 qt casserole dish is fine, with a larger bowl or plate underneath for any spills. It's enough rice for an entire day for a student; family of 4 a meal.<br /><br />B. All sorts of non-canned red/white/black beans (quick method to remove the starch, especially), but unless you have some type of bean pot to cook it, it'll take all day to cook which is impractical for the purpose of a microwave. Baked beans it's still required to do over a stove; slowly baked like Boston baked beans; or in a slow cooker, no getting around that even if you soaked it overnight to help soften it.<br /><br />C. Pastas (I cooked everything but lasagna noodles and exotic varieties): yes, you can cook mac and cheese -- including the Southern type with eggs. Homemade pasta (from scratch) takes much less time to cook, so be careful to watch the edges for over drying (like what can happen when cooking frozen entrees, when the ends get dried before it's finished cooking).<br /><br />D. Any breads that require oil for pan frying (pancakes; corn bread; Spanish and European style flat breads, etc.) requires a special microwave browning dish for browning. We use the white Corelle type cooking ware a lot, and any browning/or extended cooking the microwave will have it as a barrier on the bottom -- plate or bowl -- for safety reasons (the turning ring is useless for anything but reheating entrees that don't spill easily). Those browning dishes only need a few drops of oil, but any oil can and will catch fire (Safety tip: always around any oven or stove have a cup/box baking soda nearby. Cheap and can found almost anywhere unlike ABC fire extinguishers, which has to be maintained/recharged yearly. Also safe around food).<br /><br />Here's hoping --crossed fingers -- it will last beyond 2 years. Time will tell.<br /><br />*** Update March 2017 ***<br /><br />Microwave clock started to cycle strangely and making beeps (like if the power was turned off and back on) about 3 months ago. This morning decided to make a cup of hot water for coffee.

This has the typical very poor chinese quality control. Shame on you panasonic!<br /><br />The first one I got made so much rumbling noise along with wimpy power output for a &#34;1200&#34; watt unit. I thought surely this couldn't be considered ok or normal for the unit.<br /><br />The replacement unit I got is so poorly made: the cover of the unit doesn't fit right and I'm afraid it could be so bad that perhaps it has shielding issues with radiation, the unit exterior cover fits so bad that the interior light of the unit shines outside the unit through the cover, the blue display on this replacement unit is fuzzy and washed-out looking and fine scratches on the led display window where it was apparently wiped with a rough or dirty cloth, the whole oven rocks bad because the bottom of the unit is warped or something.  The turntable makes a clunk noise randomly as well.  What the #$%@^.<br /><br />The main features I liked about this unit are the size, the buttons and timer dial and the &#34;inverter&#34; adjustable power instead of the typical full power on/off cycling to simulate lower power levels in conventional microwaves.<br /><br />Made in China is synonymous with poor quality and poor quality control.  These 2 samples of this unit reinforce that perception.  What a shame.  If low standards of quality control and overpriced merchandise appeal to you then go ahead and try your luck.  Unfortunately we are now held hostage to all the name brand companies who have sold us all out to china.  If anyone knows a good non-chinese brand of microwave please feel free to chime in!<br /><br />update 12/2016 despite the quality control issues previously mentioned this unit is performing well so far.

We had our last microwave for about 6 years before it needed to be replaced. Figured just about any microwave would be an improvement over our 6 year old model but this is lacking.<br /><br />I will admit, the inversion technology is an improvement when it comes to heating food through evenly. Bowls of pasta are no longer cold in the middle. However, bowls of soup still have hot and cold spots. Defrost is too strong in my opinion, cooking things more than defrosting them.<br /><br />There is a couple aspects that are very irritating. There's no light in the microwave, or if there is hidden somewhere, it's never worked. It does not vent out. I open the door after cooking things and it's all wet and dripping on the inside of the door, then I need to leave it open to dry out. The timer cannot be used simultaneously with cooking.<br /><br />Probably the most irritating aspect is how difficult it is to get in touch with Panasonic about it. I've tried calling a couple times. Once I was on hold so long that I gave up. Today, I tried and got a message saying the call center was closed, even though the hours on the Web site clearly stated that it should be open. I'm going to try one more time tomorrow and then I'm giving up on it.<br /><br />Ultimately, I would say it's fine for &#34;nuking&#34; a glass of water or a TV dinner but I don't think it's worth the money at all.",2013-02-20

I am not sure if that is a defect or something out of place inside (misaligned tray or dish touching something).  Anyways, the design is very nice and modern and I got it hear for a cheap price. It's not truly stainless steel appliance you would expect.  There are some regular metal and plastic parts.  I wouldnt pay more than $80 for this though.  You can probably find something similar in the same range. If you are picky I would check this out in the store first if you like the look or not.",2013-01-30

My microwave died after two months of use - everything was working fine one moment and then the lights went out, dead as a doorstop.  (Being an electrical engineer, I think it's a safe assumption that the power supply is what died but that's only an assumption)<br /><br />Had this died within the 30 day period, Amazon would have printed out a shipping label, had UPS show up at my front door to pick up the defective unit and most likely cross-shipped a new microwave out to me so I could have a replacement in just a matter of days.  Instead, since it was outside the 30 day period, I had to go through Panasonic's warranty service.  Their only option is to have me hand-deliver the defective product to an authorized Service Center; the nearest one is a 90 minute drive from here.  That would be understandable if I lived in rural Nebraska but I live in a heavily populated area and would probably pass thirty or forty Starbucks and at least three Best Buys that I can think of on the way to the Service Center.  There's no option to ship the product by UPS; I have to drive it to the repair center.  Of course they're unlikely to repair or replace the microwave on the spot so that'll be another three hour round trip to get the repaired microwave.  This is a somewhat pricey microwave but to have to take six hours out of what little free time I have on the weekends just isn't worth the trouble.  I'll just chalk this up as an expensive lesson in how not all manufactures are customer-centric and go look for another (non-Panasonic) microwave.<br /><br />I can't comment on the overall reliability of Panasonic microwaves - I only have my own experience to go on.  Perhaps out of a thousand appliances only one dies in under three months and I'm just lucky this time around.<br /><br />As far as the design goes, some things I liked, some things take some getting used to.  The spin knob instead of numeric keypad is \\""cute\\"" and does the job but it does take some getting used to.  It's pretty easy to overshoot the time you want and have to backtrack to get to your goal.  The \\""always-on\\"" variable power setting is pretty nice - I'd much rather use continuous power than have it cycle on and off to approximate partial power.  I don't think it's quite linear, though - cooking at half power seems to deliver closer to two thirds power - two minutes at half power is much hotter than one minute at full power.  Again, you can get used to it and make adjustments based on experience.<br /><br />The \\""auto cook\\"" feature was a bust.  I eat plenty of frozen dinners and the cooking time was a) never right (food came out much hotter than if I'd just followed the directions on the box) and b) took significantly longer (I think it cooks at low power until it detect steam, then a quick blast and you're done)  If the frozen box said cook for six minutes, then \\""auto-cook, frozen dinner\\"" would take eight to ten minutes.  That feature was quickly ignored, sadly.<br /><br />Also, there are plenty of gripes here about the light not coming on when you open the door and let me add to that long list.  While you don't -need- the light to put  a plate into the microwave, it's a nice thing to be able to see what's going on.  It's really a matter of \\""what were they thinking?\\"" when the designers opted to have a dark, unlit box rather than the (very standard) lit interior.  There's no getting used to that one, it just seems wrong.  Not that it's horribly inconvenient but why did they feel the need to make it even a little bit more inconvenient than necessary?<br /><br />Would I buy this unit again (if I hadn't had reliability issues?)  Maybe, maybe not.  I can't say that the features that make this microwave more compelling (variable power, large turntable) outweigh the disadvantages (useless auto-cook programming, no interior light, odd dial interface).  There are other microwaves out there that are competitive with this one and there's no distinct advantage with going with this particular product line...<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />Quick update, 24 hours after posting this review.  On contacting the Panasonic \\""Customer Service Center\\"" I discover that it's a guy fixing appliances out of his home in a residential area!  He actually asked me to call ahead before coming down so that he could make sure he's home - and mentioned that between 8 AM and 9 AM was most convenient for him.  I was expecting at least a commercial storefront but this seems awfully small time to be the best that Panasonic could offer!<br /><br />Wanting this issue to be over and done with, I went out and bought a microwave from a different manufacturer - [[ASIN:B004WOZTKG Kenmore Stainless Steel 1.2 cu. ft. Countertop Microwave 69123]] which is OEM'ed from LG and similar in design to a number of other Kenmore and LG microwaves.  It's the same size and the same power rating but in so many ways the Kenmore is much, much nicer than this Panasonic.  The user interface is significantly more informative - to the point of displaying whole phrases (\\""reheat: plate\\"") so you've got feedback on what's happening.  The door opens much more smoothly on the Kenmore (I hadn't realized how much that mattered until I got one that worked smoothly) and low and behold, a light comes on when you open the door!  There's even a nice feature that reminds you every few minutes that the heating is finished but you forgot to take out your cup of tea.  In retrospect I guess I'm glad I got the Panasonic first because it really makes me appreciate how much more I enjoy the Kenmore's design features!

On our previous microwave when you pushed the minute button, each time it was pushed it would add a minute and then it would automatically begin cooking.  On the new machine (the &#34;Genius&#34;), you must then press the start button.  And if you have trouble seeing as we do it's a real pain to keep searching for extra buttons.  Another point, on the old machine, when you pressed &#34;Sensor Reheat&#34; it would do just that, it would sense and reheat and you did not need to push any other buttons, or as in the new machine answer a quiz like what weight something is, or whatever.

Only the front has the stainless steel finish; the sides are gray plastic (less fingerprints to wipe off). Other reviewers commented on the fact that the light only functions during operation and not when the door is open. Personally I see that as a feature and not a flaw. I like to leave the door cracked open after I have run the oven for a while to let any moisture evaporate. Anything I need to see I can use the overhead kitchen lights for. I did notice the oven is noisier than my previous oven. Not terrible, just noticeable. I love the inverter feature.

It looks beautiful in stock photos...but when you unbox this puppy it will just knock your socks off. The black/blue LED is bright and stunning and the aluminum exterior is stunning.<br /><br />I have two complaints, one of them being personal preference and the other being usability:<br /><br />Complaint 1) This thing is ridiculously powerful. I'm not certain that we were meant to have 1200 Watt Microwaves. For our wedding last year someone purchased us a Micro-wave safe potato bag that lets you nuke potatoes without poking holes in them (yay for being lazy!) and it worked WONDERFULLY for over a year in old old apartment. About 4 minutes into the 6 minute cook time on full power the bag began to smoke. As I removed it from the microwave and introduced fresh air the bag burst into flames and I had to run it outside. Needless to say, the interior of our microwave smells like smoke and I don't believe it will go away.<br /><br />luckily there IS a power setting, and I believe this first complaint is really just user error. I just wanted to post it so you'd know before you turned it on for the first time :)<br /><br />Complaint 2) There is an arbitrary numbering system when you try to use functions like soften or defrost but do not use the auto-matic mode. If I press soften once or more a number will rotate between 2,4,6,8 and then I can rotate the knob to have it produce another arbitrary number....when i hit start the specific combination of those numbers will a) adjust the power level and b) adjust the cook time. If you don't have the manual handy, this microwave can be incredibly handy.<br /><br />luckily you can get around the number mumbo jump by just using the automatic sensor modes. Sensor reheating seems to work very well...almost magical to be honest.<br /><br />Despite it being way too powerful for it's own good and having overly complex menus, I still give this guy a 4 out of 5.<br /><br />It looks awesome, has a huge interior, and does its job. What more could you ask for?<br /><br />It looks awesome, has a huge interior, and does its job. What more could you ask for?",2012-12-17

This is very nice stainless, but beware, it wraps over the top, so if you like to store things on the top, I'd recommend putting a placemat on the top to avoid scratching.<br /> I like the large interior space that holds large mixing bowls.  The light comes on not only during cooking but also when you open the door, so you can see what is going on even if you have a dark corner for your micro.<br /> I don'r have the hang of all the buttons yet, nor have I figured out the sensor settings, but honestly, most people use a microwave to reheat and to cook veggies for a set number of minutes, so it isn't a big deal.  I have used the thaw function for ground beef and it did a nice job-- thawed inside without browning the meat toward the edges.  I haven't had any issues with the opening button and have no complaints about the exhaust fan shooting out warm air toward the front.  It is really great looking, and the few fingerprints this stainless has accumulated wiped away easily.

It appears to be a fault with the inverter electronics...<br /><br />This is my second panasonic microwave in 2 years (the first one last about 2 weeks) and I bought it locally since it was cheaper. There's stuff I like and stuff I don't like -<br /><br />Stuff I like -<br />1) The light turns off when its done microwaving. Yes - I actually like the feature that the light stays off. This way, I can keep the door open when I am done microwaving and have the moisture condensation inside dry off and not allow mold/bacteria to grow. Besides, it saves me from undertaking an open/close door cycle when I have to use the microwave again.<br />2) Cooks as fast as a 1200 watt microwave should.<br />3) Nice looking - the mesh on the door is finer than usual which aids in visibilty (but read below).<br />4) Nice clear display.<br /><br />Things I don't like -<br /><br />1) The door is tinted. C'mon Panasonic - why do you want to limit my visibility? Put a clear glass door, a finer mesh on the door and tons of visibility inside.<br />2) Dumb logic - Example after inputting 10 seconds - microwave time needs to be input in 5 second intervals. The problem comes when warming baby bottles - 10 seconds is too slow, and 15 seconds is too much. 12 seems just about right - but no way to input precise times - its either 10 or 15 seconds - (jump in 5 second intervals after the first 10 seconds.<br />3) The rotary knob actually makes it a bit clumsy and slow to enter time. Keypad entry is way better.<br />4) While cooking - you cannot increase or decrease time using the rotary knob. However, you can add time using the minute button - which adds a whole minute - instead of an extra 20 seconds I might have wanted. Another example of dumb logic. Not exactly the mark of a Genius - but they call it one!<br />5) This is my biggest complaint - It is loud. Even consumer reports says so. Sounds like a bit like a quiet leaf blower. It is way louder than a very quiet 1.6 cu ft Genius model we use at work. I am just amazed that no one has commented on this aspect yet.<br /><br />I however decided to keep this model because it fit decently in the limited countertop space in my house - and I got it for a good price.a bit like a quiet leaf blower.

When I purchased this almost a year ago, it was over $50 higher.  Maybe a new model is coming out soon or something, but I think it's a great microwave at a great price.<br /><br />First thing that's important to any microwave, does the thing heat well?  This one does, 1200 watts for a small microwave such as this is more than enough power.  It cooks and heats food in a reasonable amount of time.<br /><br />Then there's appearance.  Looks may not matter to some, but it does to me and this thing looks great alongside my other stainless steel appliances.  The buttons are not cluttered, the dial is a nice touch, etc.  Very modern and sleek for a microwave.<br /><br />As for reliability, I've owned a few different brands of microwaves in the past but Panasonic has always seemed to last the longest with the fewest problems.  In my year of using this so far, I am not disappointed.  No problems whatsoever with this machine to date.<br /><br />Finally, it has several unique features and presets for an inexpensive microwave.  It has sensors that detect steam and temperature from your food items, and can automatically adjust the power level and time accordingly if you use it in this mode.<br /><br />My only gripe is sometimes it's hard to set the time exactly right with the dial.  For instance, if you want to microwave for 18 seconds, you're going to have to set it on 20 seconds because after 10 seconds the increments go in intervals of 5 seconds.

Because it has \\""inverter\\"" technology, we've found that defrosting meats and frozen foods to be a fraction of the time it took our old microwave oven to do. The auto cook feature is a time saver, and the various power settings for different foods are conveniently shown on a sticker on the inside of the oven.<br /><br />The various feature buttons are logically placed, and once you get over the initial info overload of what it does, things are pretty easy to understand.<br /><br />The fan is relatively loud but because it is so powerful, it is able to exhaust much of the steam that usually builds up during cooking.

We had it for about 4 years and it worked fine for what it was but was beginning to fail so it was time for a new one.  We ordered this model because A - we've had great success with Panasonic microwaves in the past, B - I wanted more power to speed up the process and C - I thought the \\""Inverter\\"" technology was really cool.<br />Although I've only had it a few days now I'm well prepared to share my thoughts about this microwave<br /><br />Good stuff -<br />* Looks really good<br />* Heats food much faster than our old microwave<br />* Inverter \\""reheat\\"" really does work - just push the button<br /><br />This microwave has plenty of bells and whistles.  Now that I have them I can attest that I really don't need a bunch of bells and whistles.  I really only want to reheat leftovers, cook frozen food, thaw stuff and heat canned goods.  I want to do that fairly quickly.  If you're like me and have had a few microwaves then you know it doesn't take long to get a feel for how your microwave works and you pretty much \\""know\\"" how long it will take and how much power you need.  My needs are simple - more than 1000 watts, power level and timer settings.  That's about all I use.<br /><br />The not so good<br />* Stainless finish is gorgeous until you touch it.  Finger prints are immediate.  Now I know that everyone in the family pushes the same buttons and closes the door in the upper right hand corner.  Finger prints never look good, finger prints on this product are constant unless you wear gloves when you operate it.  Nobody in my family wears  gloves.<br />* Noisy - I really didn't think this would be a big deal. Other reviewers have mentioned this as an issue, others have said it's no big deal.  It's pretty loud,  not airplane loud but louder than it needs to be.  Had I heard it operate before purchasing I would not have purchased it.  I can live with the noise but it's a bit of a distraction.<br />* Dial Selector - the selector for time and some other features is done via a dial selector that is recessed into the microwave.  Pushing it causes it to extract to a position that you can put your fingers around to turn.  You use it to set time to cook and in conjunction with \\""inverter\\"" features.  When turning the dial sometimes you hear a bit of a scraping sound.  That's the sound of the dial coming in contact with the face of the microwave.  If you hold the dial \\""just right\\"" you won't hear it.  This is the only quality issue I've seen so far and I deem it an engineering/manufacturing flaw.  The use of this selector is not obvious.  You really need to read the manual to know what to do with this thing.<br />* Sensor cook - makes no sense to me!  I first thought this would be great.  It's not.  It's a lot of work.  There are 15 food items in sensor cook.  They are accessible via the \\""Dial selector\\"".  As you turn the dial selector items 1 through 15 are displayed.  Not the description of the item, just the number.  Unless you keep your owner's manual within easy reach of the microwave  or create a list of food items and their associated number ( and maybe tape it to your microwave? ) you'll have no way of knowing what number corresponds to each food type.  This is a lot of work and seems not worth the effort.<br />* Sensor  Defrost - first weigh your food on a scale.  If your scale uses fractions ( 1/8, ¼, etc ) convert to decimal ( 1/8 = .125, ¼ - .25 ) etc.  Press \\""Sensor Defrost\\"" button.  Dial in weight.  I used \\""sensor defrost\\""  to defrost some hot dogs.  They were \\""over  defrosted\\"" and were quite warm to the touch when completed.  There is another button that allows you to select \\""more\\"" or \\""less\\"".  That's seems like it would have been even more work.  \\""Sensor Defrost\\"" summary - too much work, much easier on my older models to select power level of 3 ( or defrost even! ) and guess a time and hope for the best.<br />* Unintuitive - my wifewas the first to use it.  She  first needed to read the manual before heating up some canned green beans.  I tried it next.  I first read the manual from cover to cover.  I then thawed the hot dogs ( read previous bullet ) and had to have the manual in hand to do it.  My oldest daughter - age 30 asked \\""How the hell do you work this thing?\\""  She too needed instruction before she could use it.  My youngest daughter - age 23 \\""I'd send it back, it's way to weird\\"".  She too needed instruction just to heat a baby bottle up.  Bottom line - you need to remember \\""a lot\\"" to use this microwave and when you have guests that try to use it you can count on them asking you how to work it.  A microwave is a pretty basic appliance.  Everybody uses them.  This one requires way too much effort.<br /><br />That pretty much sums up my thoughts.  It works well cuz it is powerful but it is way too complicated.

Do not recommend.,"Arguably 2* is a bit harsh, but I do actively recommend against buying this.<br /><br />It's a pretty good looking unit which generates microwaves like a champ - no complaints there.  The inverter feature is a definite benefit IMO.<br /><br />We haven't evaluated a lot of the complex functions in terms of how well they work.<br /><br />My big gripe though, is the design - specifically what it's like to control - i.e. the user interface.  It's the all-too-common interface designed by the embedded controller engineers, rather than from the point of view of the user.<br /><br />The control nob seems like it should be great, but setting the duration is not an improved experience.  You end up relatively slowly and carefully turning it to narrow in on your desired time.  It's not exactly difficult, but it certainly isn't as easy as tapping a digit or 3 to set a time directly.<br /><br />It's a high power machine so dialing it back makes sense quite often - and that's why it has the inverter feature.  However, for power you *don't* get to use the dial.  First thing I did was tap the power button then turn the wheel, but no, that would be too easy and intuitive; with the pseudo-analog power display to watch as you do it, unlike controlling time this would actually work nicely.  Instead, to get to 40% power you tap the power button 6 times to go from 100% to 40% in 10% steps.<br /><br />Any semi-advanced usage means consulting the book.  Are you softening a quart of ice cream or a stick of butter?  You need to know the right numbers to do that: 17 and 15.<br /><br />Fairly minor:<br /><br />The Aluminum front is a fingerprint magnet<br /><br />The display blazes so bright it lights up the *adjacent* room at night.  We now have a post-it note stuck over the display at night.<br /><br />It's not quiet - not the loudest either.  I suppose that's barely a gripe.<br /><br />Overall, I when using it I'm just mildly irritated by the awkwardness of it, and regret the purchase.

The Panasonic is a powerful unit and the \\""Inverter\\"" feature does seem to heat the food more evenly.  Our old GE unit would do a good job of heating the edges of the food items and leave a cold core, but not the case with this unit.  The dial is a handy feature, whether using it to set the clock, timer or cook time.  I did read other reviews expressing concern over the fact that a light doesn't go on when the door to the microwave is opened, but this is really a non-issue.  There is no problem seeing what is inside the 1.2 cubic foot space unless one is using it in complete darkness.  The only negative to the unit is that it is a fingerprint magnet, as are most stainless steel appliances.  However, in the case of this microwave, it is really quite difficult to shut the door without touching the stainless--would have been more convenient for a small touch pad on the door to avoid having to constantly wipe off the smudges.  It is a good looking appearance and cabinet, and the blue light for the clock and readout is a handsome affect as well.<br />Our unit does have a rather loud beep volume, and it would be nice to be able to turn it down or off as is an option in other Panasonic microwave models.

I've used other Panasonic Microwaves with this feature which seemed to get the cooking time pretty close (usually undercooking about 20 seconds on that model).  This model seems to over-cook by a factor of probably double the time needed to cook the food.  There is an Add/Subtract button that can shorten or add time (heavens) to the cycle but it only shortens the cycle by about 10% which is still way too much cooking time and literally nukes the food into mush rather than just reheating it.  I've also been careful to add liquid to leftovers being reheated as this feature relies on the presence of steam to sense when to shut off the cycle.  I use a lid with full perferations around the top as I did with the other model Panasonic formerly used and the inside of the lid is literally wet with steam on the inside long before the cycle shuts off.  Also, when the machine first senses moisture, it switches from full power to half power for a shorter amount of \\""finishing\\"" time.  On the old microwave, the finishing time was typically about 20 seconds.  The finishing time on this was more like another minute longer (this when the food was already nuked by the switchover time.  I'd say the old microwave would probably heat on full power for about a minute or a bit more before it's 20 second switchover.  This one cooks like for 2 or more minutes, before a minute or more additional switchover time rendering this feature pretty useless (the one feature that Panasonic is supposedly famous for and why I choose a Panasonic again for doesn't work properly now).

The box's appearance when I brought it inside frightened me a bit.. it was battered and beaten! I heard the UPS guy bringing it in and it sounded like he \\""flipped it\\"" up the stairs and plopped it at the door.. I thought neighbors were moving in or out of the apartment. It was tripple-boxed with two outside boxes and the retail box as the final container. Only the retail box had any padding to it.. I suppose the other two were just sacrificial :) At any rate I found no issues with the unit and the retail box looked untouched, so I guess they know what they're doing in the way of packing.<br /><br />By outline, let me say this was purchased to replace a GE unit I bought about 1989 that was rated about 1500 watts.. all analog dials and motors.. nothing digital. The new unit STUNNED me at it's light weight.. the old unit was about 70 lbs! .. this one is so light, that if I lean ever-so-slightly on the open door, it tips precariously threatening to fall off the low shelf I have it sitting on.<br /><br />PLUSES:<br />Let me say that I LOVE the efficiency and heat delivery capability of this unit.. and the \\""inverter technology\\"" too. It cooks in 1/2 to 1/3 the time of the old one and it's heat is much more evenly delivered across the food. I also love the spin table... It's heavy duty (but it is glass), free-turning and lifts out for easy cleaning.. The clean lines of the oven interior also makes for easy cleaning.It has another \\""feature\\"" I like which I didn't see mentioned, but observed. Each time you press the \\""door\\"" button, the carousel reverses direction.<br /><br />I love the \\""sensor functions\\"" with the sensor apparently mounted in the exhaust-air stream.. My old one had a \\""sensor cook\\"" that required a thermometer-like sensor to be put in the dish.. and of course it was among the first things that failed on that unit.. I just used it without that function. Hopefully this one will not fail soon mounted outside the oven.<br /><br />Of the things I have tried, the problems related to understanding the use of the oven and it's peculiarities rather than the way in which it cooks.<br /><br />A TALE OF POPCORN:<br />Relating my experience with popcorn-making is revealing. The button \\""Popcorn\\"" cycles through 3 \\""weights\\"" that conform to the commercial pre-made packs rather than to making popcorn alone (which is what I do).. I pop plain popcorn, then spray with olive oil and add a season-salt mix. I have played with the button in an effort to \\""fine-tune\\"" my application. I  tried using the 3+oz setting, then a 1.75oz setting to my \\""handfull\\"" measurement.. that burned the popcorn somewhat.. then I tried the 3+oz setting followed by just a quick-minute.. still a bit too much. Then I tried a 3+oz setting with a \\""more\\"" push.. too little.. Now I use a 3+oz setting with 2 \\""more\\"" presses.. about right.. that is an idea of the kind of playing you may have to do to get some special thing you want done to be done right.. takes about 2+ minutes.. good luck! :) On my old unit I heated it for 7 minutes, then ran it untimed until the pops were spaced more than about 10 seconds.. this one would have a roaring fire in the popcorn if I used it at full power for 7 minutes! :)<br /><br />ANNOYANCES:<br /><br />Control logic:<br />The controls layout have little logical relationship to function.. I'd strongly advise scanning the manual if you plan to do much more than just warm coffee :) The buttons are generally \\""menu function\\"" (ie related to WHAT you're heating) rather than \\""cook function\\"" (ie power, time, store/retrieve, etc) oriented.. in fact there are actually several groupings of buttons that don't have an immediately obvious relationship.. it definitely takes some getting used to.<br /><br />-At the top is the digital display.. very nice, bright, legible..<br />-Popcorn, Sensor Heat, SensorCook are the top three.. how in the world are those related??<br />-Power Level, Inverter Turbo Defrost, Keep Warm are the next three... huh?<br />-Inverter Melt & Soften, Quick Minute, and More/Less are the next row.. more huh?<br />-next is the popup spin dial.. it can modify several button settings like clock, wieght, sensor select, etc.. ok that's fine<br />-recipe store, timer, clock are the next row.. ??<br />-stop/reset, and start are the next row.. AT LAST functional relationships!<br />finally the push button for the door latch.. that's the controls combined with the \\""recipes\\"" contained on the base of the cabinet under the cavity with the door open pretty much finishes it up other than the manual.<br />The logic of this layout totally elludes me.. you just have to memorize the stuff and how to use it. Each function in itself is logical.. for examply setting the clock, setting \\""sensor cook\\"", timer, etc. but the grouping seems random. I admit I've not thought about how I'd do it, but then I'm not in the microwave-design business :)<br /><br />Also if you have weak eyes such as mine, forget reading the small labels and the cook chart without optical aids. On that point, I will say that the manual is pretty legible with bold, large print and charts generally (except for the \\""fine-print\\"" warnings, etc)<br /><br />I also don't like the push-button door latch .. my old one had the latch built into the handle and worked crisply and cleanly for many years.. this one is mushy and I think just asking for problems with wear, dirt, etc... not to mention that it's hard to find in the dark. I noted at least one other reviewer has experienced a latch-related failure.<br /><br />As others have also said, the \\""recipe\\"" button, with only one storage capability, seems next to useless to me. I am not much bothered by the light only being on while cooking.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />I have rated this 4-star.. It has plenty of \\""issues\\"" but my feeling is that they don't stand in the way of the fine way in which the unit delivers heat..<br /><br />The unit has so many nice capabilities that, in spite of it's problems and illogical and confusing interface I still rate it a solid 4-stars+.Cook are the top three.. how in the world are those related??<br />-Power Level, Inverter Turbo Defrost, Keep Warm are the next three... huh?<br />-Inverter Melt & Soften, Quick Minute, and More/Less are the next row.. more huh?<br />-next is the popup spin dial.. it can modify several button settings like clock, wieght, sensor select, etc.. ok that's fine<br />-recipe store, timer, clock are the next row.. ??<br />-stop/reset, and start are the next row..

The price of the new one is pretty much the same as the old one!<br /><br />I am vey pleased with the new features, especially the programability.  My old microwave was basically just timed cooking.  Timed cooking on the this new one is still intuitive and I expect to be able to use all the features once I experiment a little with them.  The manual is not bad but I will have to play with sequential programing to figure it out.  It even has a timer that can work when the microwave is not on!<br /><br />I was surprised to find that this oven at 1200 watts cooks just as fast as my very old 1300-watt oven I replaced.

When we remodeled our kitchen we changed all the appliances to Stainless Steel. I could not find an over the range microwave with the inverter technology, so we bought a standard model. After 8 months without it I was so upset. Once you learn how to use the lower power settings, everything reheated comes out so much better. Since I couldn't find an over the range model, I bought this one for the counter. Yes I now have two microwaves in our kitchen. It actually is wonderful being able to cook in two microwaves at the same time.<br />  Why is the inverter technology so great. When reheating things like chicken, by using a lower power setting, the chicken still tastes like it did the first time around. It really shines when reheating a meals, or softening butter (without melting it). If you cook everything at full power, then you don't need the inverter technology. Your loss.<br />  The only other thing I want to say is how easy it is to use. I love the knob instead of pressing a buttons to set the time.

After a little over a month of use the overall experience so far has been very positive.  In looking for a microwave oven we were restricted in size due to a built-in area in our cabinets for a microwave.  Because of this the microwave oven cannot be too big otherwise it will not fit in the space and this is frustrating because too many times small means cheap and poor performance.  After a lot of research I happened across the Panasonic 681S and so we have been very satisified with the purchase.  This microwave is replacing a GE microwave oven that we've had for about six years and the comparison in this review will be against this GE microwave oven.<br /><br />PROS of the Panasonic 681S to the GE:<br />* The overall controls for the Panasonic microwave take some getting used to, but after a little use it's very easy to use and we actually prefer this control panel setup over the more \\""standard\\"" setup of the GE.<br />* Power - the Panasonic is much quicker at heating than the GE.  We can now cook frozen items based on the package times and not have to add extra time to account for the poor performance of the GE.<br />* Defrost mode - the Panasonic is much better at defrosting than any microwave we've ever owned.  It does an excellent job at defrosting meat throughout without \\""cooking\\"" the edges.  This was something we always had to be careful of with the GE.<br />* Popcorn - excellent job popping popcorn and really like the adjustment for various bag sizes.  Even though the GE had a \\""popcorn\\"" mode we always had to catch it at the end of its cycle and add an extra minute of time and then listen and stop it before the popcorn started to burn.<br />* Baked Potatoes - the Panasonic does an excellent job with baked potatoes and again out performs the GE.<br />* Easy to read display.<br />* Looks nice.<br /><br />CONS of the Panasonic 681S to the GE:<br />* No light when the door is opened.  The interior light only comes on when he microwave is running and provides less light than the GE.<br />* If weight is an indicator of overall construction and durability then the GE wins because it is much heavier than the Panasonic.  However so far there is nothing to show the Panasonic is any less durable than the GE and in fact the GE's touch pad had to be replaced within the first three months of ownership.  Time will tell on this point.<br />* Stainless steel shows finger prints - but this would be a problem with ANY stainless steel appliance, but it looks great when it's clean.<br />* For some reason this model of Panasonic microwave is hard to find.  Seems to always be out of stock, or only in stock for a brief time.  Not sure why this is.<br /><br />Overall we're pleased with this microwave oven and based on our experience to date for the money would recommend this for someone who is looking for a very good microwave oven in this size and price range.the GE:<br />* No light when the door is opened.

Steaming vegetables takes about 1 minute less than with our previous microwave. Heating a beverage takes less than a minute now. I will say though that steaming can really kick up alot of moisture inside the microwave. It gets moist to the point of being fairly wet, needing a towel dry.<br /><br />I've not used the sensor reheat feature on any microwave before this one. Frankly I expected the sensor reheat to be something of a gimmick. However it does an outstanding job of reheating food thoroughly. As a test I reheated a plate of chicken, potatoes, and veggies together and was surprised how each item was more or less 'appropriately' reheated. Only a couple of instances over the past few months when something was a little cooler on the inside than outside after a reheat.<br /><br />As a parent of young children I appreciate the child lock feature. Which is a code that when entered sets the microwave into an unresponsive, stasis mode. Enter the unlock \\""code\\"" to reactivate. The child lock is easy to use, and as long as your kids don't learn the \\""code\\"", it should keep the occasional, or habitual button masher from accidentally turning the microwave on when you're not looking.<br /><br />This unit is loaded with a variety of features and settings. Some of which may not be familiar to all users. Fortunately Panasonic provides a pretty straightforward users guide that does a good job explaining the various features and their functions.<br /><br />Wireless users be aware, this microwave, located in about the center of our 600 sq ft first floor, decimates the wi-fi signal for the entire floor when running. Music, movies, downloads, anything that requires a wireless signal stops shortly after we begin using the microwave. Changing router locations (located on the 2nd floor) did not help whatsoever. Not a deal breaker, but those whose smoke/CO2 detectors are interconnected via wi-fi should probably make note of this. I'd guess this is a potential problem for most microwaves, so I won't knock Panasonic for this.<br /><br />Unfortunately this microwave does not have the best alert/reminder system. It beeps 5 times after finishing its cycle. That's it. I haven't noticed it providing any follow up warning of completion beyond that. Our previous unit had a steady, 4 second beep and would beep every couple of minutes thereafter until it was opened. A much better system in my opinion.<br /><br />Other thoughts. It turns out that no light when opening the door isn't such a big deal for me. The blue LED screen is easy to read. Stainless steel is a very sleek and modern look, and it does pick up prints easily. This unit is a space saver compared to similar units. Coming from an all push-button microwave, I appreciate the retractable knob control more than I thought I would.<br /><br />Looking at the whole picture in terms of price, features, and performance, and I feel the NN-SD681S is a solid value and would recommend it to anyone currently in the market for a microwave.<br /><br />Update (April 2013):<br /><br />The microwave continues to perform well after more than a year of moderate use. We barely notice it's there, which is a testimony to its effectiveness.<br /><br />Two things I have noticed:<br /><br />1. It's loud. Forget having a conversation with someone across the room when this thing is on. Though given that we don't run it for more than a few minutes at at time (boiling veggies for example), it's not a big hindrance to us.<br /><br />2. The door release button does require some effort/force to open. As a parent of younger children that's actually a plus for us. However I can see where some users might be turned off by that.<br /><br />Update (March 2014)<br /><br />Just a quick update to verify that the microwave is still going strong after more than 2 years of service.

If you've ever seen the little German microwave that Williams Sonoma sells for $350, this looks the same (except it's a whole lot more useful.)  It looks modern, is the perfect size for a couple who heats burritos, TV dinners, and leftovers -- the sensor function is great for this.  You're going to have to memorize what the hard keys are for because you can't see the printing over top of them.  This is not a deal-breaker -- there are not that many keys.  It is a little loud but it's not an unpleasant noise -- a medium level frequency like an exhaust fan on medium.  The light not coming on when the door is open is a plus, actually.  You can leave the door open after cooking a burrito to air out the oven and not have to worry about forgetting to close it.  Overall, a very slick unit.",2012-01-09

It's a piece of art and looks great in the kitchen.  The knob is very useful and so far it's made microwaving fun!  The knob is turned to increase/decrease cooking time and adjust the clock.  It rotates very smoothly.  There is a quick minute button available, but I find the knob more convenient.  There are additional options such as sensor reheat, etc..  I haven't had the chance to use it these options yet.  For price that you great, I'd greatly recommend this microwave.  One of the things that don't bug me but seems to bug other people is that there is no light when you open the door.  To me, this is fine, but I can see how that could be annoying to someone who wants to microwave in the dark!",2012-01-03

So far no regrets..  I had not bought a new microwave oven in quite a while, so did a lot of research on brands, their ratings and what to look for and avoid.  Panasonic rated very well and I've had good luck with other consumer products from them before so we chose this unit. We got it through Amazon as no local retailer(s) carried or even listed it and most of the other microwaves that I saw were either too small, far too big or looked really cheap..  I felt this was a stylish, yet well-priced choice that was the right size for us and fit our needs.<br /><br />I think it's nice looking and I also like the blue display which is bright and very readable. I've not played around with the functionality much but can say that the sensor reheat function works very well for reheating things. Just put the item in, hit sensor reheat + start and it does the rest. That being said, be careful when reheating certain liquids such as milk or cream.<br /><br />+ : Likes - (in no order)<br /><br /> A - Size (a good compromise and perfect for our needs - two adults, no kids)<br /> B - Functionality<br /> C - Looks<br /><br />- : Dislikes - (in no order)<br /><br /> A - Interior light works when unit is on but NOT when you open the door!?<br /> B - Brushed stainless finish looks nice but shows finger prints and smudges very easily.<br /> C - Sometimes when you push the button, the door doesn't always 'pop' open all the way, instead it kinda opens 'halfway' and you<br />  have to put your finger underneath to finish the job.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this unit to others.  As it's been less than a month, I cannot say how reliable it will end up being though but am keeping my fingers crossed.  If we have any problems, I'll update this review.",2011-12-15

I'll keep it short and stick to the things I noticed:<br />1) No light when you open the door, which is odd, but doesn't really bother me.<br />2) You set the cooking time with a dial, rather than typing it in on a keypad. The dial to set the cooking time is good, I guess. Not much easier or more difficult than a keypad, so I don't have a strong opinion about it.<br />3) Prior models (according to reviews) had problems with the door lock and the display. Both are great on this model. Door locks solidly and the display is very easy to read.<br />4) The Sensor Reheat button worked very well the few times I've used it to reheat leftovers. They came out nice and hot, but not overdone. That's the only feature I've used, other than just setting a time and pushing \\""start\\"".<br />Overall, we are happy with this product, after about a month of daily use. It's a good compromise between power and size. I wanted a more powerful microwave than our prior, very compact, one. I also wanted to have it be a reasonably small size, so I checked dimensions carefully. This one had the best size/power combination for us.",2011-12-07
US,52894480,R2VKU64KO1E3VP,B005BFZ5N6,978779937,Panasonic NN-SN686S Countertop/Built-In Microwave with Inverter Technology,Kitchen,5.0,110.0,122.0,N,Y,A modest improvement over its predecessor,"In most ways, this microwave oven is similar to the earlier [[ASIN:B001V7R5I6 Panasonic Prestige NN-SD688S]] model. Both are virtually identical in size, and most functions overlap. The functional changes, though minor, are not insignificant.<br /><br />The NN-SD688S model improved upon its predecessor by replacing its cluttered interface with a more simple and usable one. This model retains that look and feel. It uses a dial for setting time, weight, cook settings, or other parameters that formerly used a keypad. On this model, the dial can be retracted when not in use. A big improvement over the previous model is the display. It now uses brighter blue numbers that can be seen from a bigger range of angles and heights, and should satisfy the objections people had to the earlier model. The new display also shows the cook level throughout the cook cycle, rather than only when setting it.<br /><br />In addition to standard features such as timed cooking, a sensor reheat function, defrosting, popcorn and keep warm buttons, there are fourteen sensor cook settings for specific foods. The NN-SD688S had nine. When the door is open, a label lists the number to use for each food item, so fourteen settings are not overwhelming as they were on the earlier touch pad models. The beverage button disappeared when the previous model was released, and is still lacking. I found that feature useful on other microwaves.<br /><br />By dialing a number for the cook setting, it has the appearance of setting a cook level. Since the items for each number seem unrelated, it's not possible to decide that something might be between eggs and soup and choose a level in between. However, many microwave ovens have specific buttons for certain foods, just as this has a popcorn button. I wouldn't question what else I could cook with a frozen pizza button, but consumers might question what level six (really setting six) can cook besides pizza.  If you think of it as a replacement for fourteen preprogrammed buttons, you can appreciate its added simplicity for the listed foods.<br /><br />Another addition is the Melt and Soften button. It can be used for melting chocolate, softening butter or cream cheese, and there's even a setting for softening ice cream. I haven't tried those settings yet, but they include ones I'd actually use.<br /><br />There is a \\""recipe store\\"" button that can store only a single recipe at a time, so if popcorn is not your thing and you want a custom button for something else specific, you can use it.<br /><br />The inverter function raises or lowers the power level generatated by the oven, rather than controlling power by cycling on and off. The power was reduced to 1200 watts from the previous model's 1300 watts. I'm not sure how much difference it will make with the inverter settings, but could potentially affect anything heated at full power. Many recipes assume that you have 1000 watts, so cook time may be closer to that in a recipe. But I'd rather set less time and figure that out myself.<br /><br />The previous model's stylistic flair was replaced with a more spartan but high end appearance. That model's four small feet provided little traction, causing the oven to move for some users when the door button was pressed. This model has pads on the front feet that prevent it from slipping. When I first tried it out, it didn't slip. When I moved it to its final location, it slipped far too much. Strangely enough, the back feet are no longer there, and the microwave sits on bare metal surfaces there. I ended up using an adhesive non-slip putty to keep the microwave in place. Perhaps the surface wasn't perfectly flat, but the feet don't seem to be adjustable. The new feet may or may not be an improvement.<br /><br />The light does not go on when the door is open, and only lights while cooking. Many users find that very objectionable. I didn't like that omission, probably because I was used to having a light, but in a microwave with a whitesurface, it's less of a need than in a much larger conventional oven.<br /><br />This model lets you set up to three consecutive cook settings (as opposed to its predecessor's five) so you could set a one hour delay, a cook time at a certain level, and a keep warm stage, for example. Five seemed excessive but I don't see what Panasonic gained by lowering it. In the example they gave in their previous manual, setting a cook time at one level followed by a cook time at a different level (something that instructions on food boxes sometimes suggest) could not be integrated with my example.  Once the start button is pressed, all stages will be executed sequentially. The timer stage can be used independently, but not concurrently. With the microwave I'm replacing, I very often used the timer, even while the microwave was cooking. I find that loss a bigger annoyance than the light issue.del lets you set up to three consecutive cook settings (as opposed to its predecessor's five) so you could set a one hour delay, a cook time at a certain level, and a keep warm stage, for example.

I called them up, and their customer service knew nothing. A search on the Panasonic website came back blank.<br />So, what the heck, I bought it. It appeared to be very similar to the SD688 models, with one exception. The digital display got panned on the 688 as being hard to read from a normal standing angle. I guessed that this fancy blue display was their answer to that, and I was right! The bright blue display is very easy to read up close without bending over., and from an angle.<br />I rarely cook in a microwave, so all of the fancy button options are moot. \\""Inverter Melt\\"", \\""Popcorn\\"" \\""Inverter Turbo Defrost\\"". If I have to keep the manual handy to use my microwave, I'm not likely to use that feature.<br />I did try the \\""Sensor Reheat\\"" feature on some boneless chicken. It stopped it at the right time.<br />I like the dial feature, it's very intuitive. The one minute button is nice.<br />One thing a Microwave does, is it sits there on the counter most of the time doing nothing. This does that very well. The SS finish and the square lines look really good. At 20\\"" wide, it just right for my counter. It's taller than my old oven, so I can fit my salad dressing cruet in there.<br />Another thing a microwave should do is last for years. We'll have to see on that one.<br />I will update as more details become apparent.<br />More observations 10/12/11:<br />I tried the Sensor Reheat a few more times. It seems to work pretty well. It's weird though if your timing your food prep, setting the table, or whatever, because there's no preset time.<br />The 'Inverter Melt' function works quite well. Here is where the inverter technology makes a difference - it actually heats at low power. Conventional microwaves just cycle full power off and on to achieve 'low' power.<br />I tried 'Sensor Cook' with some potatoes. I set it on 3. Silly me - 3 is for omelets. For potatoes, use 7. Fresh vegetables - 8. There's no explanation what the different settings actually mean. Forget it.<br />So with all this fancy technology, Panasonic could have added one basic non-technological feature:<br />The light. It only comes on while cooking. But not when you open the door. Really? That's enough to almost give me buyers remorse. It never occurred to me that this feature, that's been around for 30 years, would be missing.<br /><br />Edit 2/18/12: After 4 months and prompting by a fellow reviewer, I'm bumping this to 4 stars. Mechanically, the engineering is excellent. The inverter technology is extremely useful, making it a more versatile and valuable tool in the cooking process.<br />Still, the software side is gimmicky and borderline absurd . Take the Melt & Soften button, for 1 example. I can melt butter by setting the power to 1 or 2 and 30 seconds. Or I can use the  Melt & soften button, saving me several whole button pushes! I have a choice of 15,16,17,and 18. But,it would be nice to know which power setting that button selects, instead of \\""Butter, Cream Cheese\\"", etc. Imagine if your conventional oven had settings for Ham, Chicken, and Turkey, but didn't tell you the temperature if you use them.
