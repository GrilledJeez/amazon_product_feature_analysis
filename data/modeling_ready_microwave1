And the inverter is probably the cause of the WiFi scrambling.",block wifi house died usually recognize door closed turn problem's getting worse past month unusable warranty right yes want spend life trying unresponsive unhelpful people jumping ridiculous hoop maybe portion money start 12 month reason model inverter realize inverter better cooking heat transfer perspective previous technology simply cycle off control rate heating inverter probably wifi scrambling

49552912,RBN8SWU19V2NI,B0009KMYHI,2.0,2.0,2.0,Y,DEAD microwave after 2.3 yrs in one-person household.,"This replaced a another brand's simpler, less costly microwave that lived for 8+ years, which didn't impress me, compared to the longer life of the even simpler, less expensive one before it.  So to say that I'm disgusted with this product's 2.3-year lifespan is an understatement.  It pains me to award any stars to what is burying humanity under mountains of quickly discarded metals and plastics.  But for a brief while it worked as it's supposed to, although I never adored this model.  (Had I not found a new one here for only $140, the high end of what I was willing to pay, I never would have purchased more functions than I needed).  So I'll try to comment on what it was before the magnetron stopped working (the programming panel and lights still function, but beeps and a few watts of illumination don't cook food).  Context: used several times almost every day by one middle-aged woman for mostly non-elaborate purposes (heat water, soups, steel-cut oatmeal; steam veggies; melt butter; re-heat left-overs; defrost frozen homemade soups, etc; warm heat packs).  The unit, which was kept very clean, sat on open chrome shelving, with abundant air flow on all sides.  It had its own outlet and, during the last half of its meager life, drew power through a surge protector.  Here are some of the pluses, minuses, and in-betweens, which you can interpret in the above context and translate into what's relevant for your context and purposes: + I did enjoy the time-efficiency of more power than I &#34;needed,&#34; but that is not something I'll pay extra for. + The matte black exterior was very attractive for my purposes, easy to clean, and still looked new after two years. + I selected one beep and no 'reminder,' which was enough to get my attention (perhaps too quiet for some) in a not unpleasant manner.  ~ Although larger than I &#34;needed,&#34; it was nice not to be limited by space -- except vertically.  The proportions were slightly off for me: I would've swaped part of an inch of width for a wee bit more height so a quart-size jar could stand inside.  - I very much do not like push-button latches on microwaves.  On this unit, the door already was becoming a bit draggy after only two years.    - I did not like the button and keypad setup (additionally, the keypad plastic already was wearing out in places after just two years).  Visually, it's not fast-and-easy to see. I mostly use the &#34;one minute&#34; and numeral buttons, so wish those would be clearest and at the top, and put the other stuff at the bottom. - The keypad design also lacks tactile variation (analogous to a page of text without paragraph breaks).  Once familiar with a unit, one would hope to be able to mostly 'feel' one's way to do the most simple, oft-repeated operations, such as heating up a beverage, without turning on lights and carefully looking for the &#34;one minute&#34; square.  As to that particular example, I finally affixed a piece of tape so I could feel that often-used spot on the unit.  Because I didn't need or want myriad programming options for cooking, defrosting, etc., please rely on more appropriate reviewers for that.  (For me, it was just unnecessary mental and keypad 'clutter' that, but for getting a good price on the unit at the time, I would not have choosen for myself.)

Well, today, I finally had enough, and tore into the unit to figure out what the problem was.<br /><br />Due to the intermittent nature of the problem, I figured it was a microswitch that was either broken, or not being actuated.

Then I took the cover off; you will need a T20 Torx Security bit to get the back screws out. Then open the door.<br /><br />Then, looking at the side of the unit, you will see a metal bracket protruding from the inside front of the unit, with two screws that hold the latch mechanism and three microswitches. My theory is that over time, this latch mechanism has been pushed back along the bracket, such that the upper microswitch isn't always closing, because the upper door latch isn't dropping down into position fully.<br /><br />Anyway, loosen the upper and lower screws, push the whole latch mechanism back towards the front of the unit, and re-tighten the screws. Now close the door. If you use a flashlight, you can see the three orange &#34;tits&#34; on the three microswitches, and see if they are being operated with authority.

I WOULD SUGGEST YOU DO THE SAME.. YOU CAN FEEL WHERE IT IS STRONGER AT THE TOP OF THE BUTTON IN THE MIDDLE.  I AM ABSOLUTELY THRILLED ALSO WITH THE WHOLE DEAL FROM GADZOOKS ON AMAZON I JUST CAN'T TELL YOU!!  MY LAST 1300 WATT PANASONIC FINALLY WENT OUT (20 YEARS +) SO THAT IS WHY I OPTED TO GET THIS ONE!

However, I am very disappointed with this microwave.  It worked great... for a year.  A few months after the warranty expired, the microwave went on the fritz.<br /><br />When I set the amount time to cook and hit start, the time starts counting down for about 2 seconds (the cooking mechanism doesn't even turn on) and then it just shuts off.

(I learned this would work after taking my frustration out on the microwave.)  At the same time this problem started, I also had problems with door.  The light inside the microwave is not shutting off, as a sensor in the microwave does not detect that the door is closed.  Slamming it shut makes no difference.  It also trips the fuse sometimes when it's on.  Now that I can get it to work by banging on the outside, I have realized that it is not cooking the food properly.

I don't know if it is the sensor or the inverter function that makes it so.  I suspect it's a combination of both.  Unlike conventional microwaves, the lower power settings don't just cycle the magnetron on and off.  It actually cooks at a reduced power.  This, combined with accurate sensing ability means you can actually cook something automatically besides popcorn.  I have even defrosted frozen meat without it cooking, although the very edge corner got just slightly brown.  The power is very high.  If you cook timed frozen products, I suggest reducing the cooking time by about 15-20% of the shorter suggested time for 1000 to 1100 watt ovens.  Baked potatoes come out perfectly using sensor cook as do the reheat and keep warm functions.  Again, as the food cooks using the sensor, the oven gradually reduces the power output to a lower level.  This seems to finish the cooking perfectly.  I highly recommend it.",2014-10-21,168,"This is without a doubt the best microwave that I have ever owned.  I don't know if it is the sensor or the inverter function that makes it so.

My wife and I used it daily, about 10-15 times per day, mostly for heating water for coffee or tea, approximately two minutes thirty seconds per use. The date of manufacture was July 2013. We purchased it in March 2014. We noticed a slight smoke odor one morning, and three days later the unit died while heating a cup of water.    The Amazon return policy only covers 30 days from date of purchase so we had to contact Panasonic for repairs.    It took two phone calls to get Panasonic's full attention. With the first call, on a Friday, we were assigned a case number, and told a rep would contact us within 24-48 hours. When that didn't happen, we called again the following Tuesday. From that point, however, the procedure went surprisingly quickly and smoothly. We received a postage paid recycled shipping box within three days. The box was picked up by Fedex the next morning and shipped from West Virginia to Maryland (the nearest repair site). One week later, we received the repaired unit. The shipping insert indicated a printed wiring board had failed.    The entire period, from failure to repair, was about 17 days. This is a long time to go without a microwave, but a relatively short time for getting a unit shipped, repaired and returned. So kudos to Panasonic for being nimble. Not knowing how long we might have had to wait, we purchased a 1000W Fridaire unit from a local Lowe's for the interim. We actually like the Frigidaire unit better. It's slightly smaller, does the job, and doesn't interfere with nearby WiFi devices. This latter phenomenon we found a little spooky.

My favorite feature is the sensor setting, which automatically stops the microwave when it senses the food is hot.

One problem I've found is that the glass rotating plate has a large diameter and doesn't fit nicely in a normal sized dishwasher.  It is easy to handwash though.    I followed the advice of other reviewers and attached the product to a surge protector that is plugged into a GFCI outlet and have had no problems, even through several thunderstorms in which the power went out.

50653643,RTE3IMU79RH2M,B0009KMYHI,1.0,3.0,3.0,Y,A second extremely disappointing experience with Amazon's Warehouse Deals program,"My first purchase from Warehouse Deals was a B&D handheld vacuum that failed to charge...returning it was, of course, inconvenient, but not difficult.<br /><br />I understand that the products available through this program are returns, and that you take a chance in exchange for the savings. When my old microwave began to get senile, I thought I'd give Warehouse Deals a second chance. I chose an oven with the features I wanted and for which the product description indicated the ONLY problem was minor cosmetic damage.<br /><br />First, the product arrived with the glass turntable loose in the microwave cabinet; the styro ring normally used to isolate and protect the big hunk of GLASS was on top of the oven, outside the cabinet, and it was broken into several pieces. Because the turntable was loose inside the oven, the turntable pivot ring was broken, but there w a s no other apparent damage. Finally, the inside of the oven still had food dried on the turntable and the top of the cabinet...and not just a little.<br /><br />What does this mean to you? It means that whoever Amazon asked to inspect the return at their warehouse really phoned it in, and if you're considering a Warehouse Deals purchase, the product descriptions are not to be trusted.<br /><br />Since I had saved a lot by ordering a warehouse return, and since I knew what a pain it would be to repack and return the unit, I cleaned it, repaired the broken ring, and tested the oven out. It worked, and it warmed and cooked much better than my 15-year-old Sharp.

When my old microwave began to get senile, I thought I'd give Warehouse Deals a second chance. I chose an oven with the features I wanted and for which the product description indicated the ONLY problem was minor cosmetic damage.First, the product arrived with the glass turntable loose in the microwave cabinet; the styro ring normally used to isolate and protect the big hunk of GLASS was on top of the oven, outside the cabinet, and it was broken into several pieces. Because the turntable was loose inside the oven, the turntable pivot ring was broken, but there w a s no other apparent damage. Finally, the inside of the oven still had food dried on the turntable and the top of the cabinet...and not just a little.What does this mean to you? It means that whoever Amazon asked to inspect the return at their warehouse really phoned it in, and if you're considering a Warehouse Deals purchase, the product descriptions are not to be trusted.Since I had saved a lot by ordering a warehouse return, and since I knew what a pain it would be to repack and return the unit, I cleaned it, repaired the broken ring, and tested the oven out. It worked, and it warmed and cooked much better than my 15-year-old Sharp.

First off, it is very sleek to look at; we have ours caddy-cornered at a countertop bend and as appliances go, this black microwave looks attractive.  The buttons are neatly laid out on the panel, the interface is simple and the LED readout is a pleasant green.  It rests on four hard rubber feet in the corners which keep the microwave firmly planted and vibration free during operation.  The power output on this microwave is very high, it took some getting used to not overcook things.  Even now, we do not cook things for the entire recommended times food packages say as we have learned how to compensate for this microwaves higher power.  Plus, there is a power level function that allows you to cook at lower power settings if your cooking needs require.  The Invertor defrost is a good function that defrosts frozen foods fairly even as well.<br />Overall, this microwave was an excellent choice and has stood the test of time extremely well.  I do not hesitate to recommend it.  At the time we bought it, this microwave came recommended as a Consumer Reports top pick.<br />I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review.",2014-03-16,232,"We bought this microwave in 2008 and have been using it every day for the past six years.This 1250 watt Panasonic microwave is terrific.

I still love it.","The Panasonic NN-H765WF is a strange mixed bag.<br /><br />Compared to my 4 year old 1.2 cf microwave, this new 1.6 cf unit is much lighter.  It also feels much more flimsy.  Of course the Panasonic also cost less than half what I paid 4 years ago for my old unit.<br /><br />The Panasonic has a huge cooking chamber, but the lack of height feels a little out of place for a 1.6 cf unit.  I might have opted for the 2.2 cf model just to have the extra height, not that anything I actually cook need it.<br /><br />The display looks fine straight on, but if read from above (if on a counter) you see all the unlit elements in the display screen.  Normally, a contrast control would fix that issue, but we don't have that option here.<br /><br />The unit running noise is much quieter than my old microwave, and that also applies to the beep when done cooking.  I'm glad it's quit in my situation, but others may have a hard time hearing it in some situations.<br /><br />The feet on the bottom are very small and non-grip, so it's best to push the unit all the back to the wall to avoid movement when using the keypad or opening/closing the door.<br /><br />The unit seems to cook very evenly, and I'm very happy about that.  However, the unit also seems to use much more than the 1450 Watts of power that's stated on the nameplate.  According to my kill-a-watt meter, when cooking at 100% power. the unit draws 1957 Watts with a very good 0.99 power factor.  That's more than you can draw from a 15 Amp circuit, and is more than you really should be drawing from even a 20 amp circuit (80% of 2400 Watts = 1920 Watts).  The thin power cord, at these high power levels, also doesn't lead to a feel of quality.<br /><br />Surprisingly, even with the high power factor when cooking, the power factor when at idle (running the clock) in shockingly low.  According to my kill-a-watt meter, the unit uses only 1.6 watts when idle but at a super-poor power factor of only 0.08.  This gives 21.2 Volt-Amps draw.  Even though residential electric customers don't currently pay a penalty for the low PF currently, this could change in the future.  In any case, it's poor design to have such a low PF on new electronics and appliances.<br /><br />Despite all the flaws, I still think the Panasonic inverter microwaves are the best there is.  I wish we could get the technology in a better thought out and higher quality unit, but at the current price, you do get what you pay for.<br /><br />PS: Many of the common reliability complaints about these units have easy fixes that can be found by searching youTube.<br /><br />Also, to avoid the issues with the door getting hard to close and not registering properly, don't just slam the door shut.  Get into the habit of pressing in the door button, closing the door, then releasing the door button.  This can avoid bending the metal bracket that the hooks latch into.  Yes, it's a bad design by Panasonic and this should not be required, but it is, if you want to avoid a very common problem in these Panasonic inverter microwaves.<br /><br />For those running this microwave off of a generator or inverter (link in an RV or off-grid home,) here are the volt-amps readings I just did  using my kill-a-watt meter at all ten cooking power levels.

35750022,R1XELARMR7IFLP,B0009KMYDW,4.0,2.0,2.0,Y,Great,"I was in a hurry to replace my broken microwave and living on the edge of nowhere my round trip drive time is 3 hours to do any brick and mortar shopping. Add actual shopping time and this never takes less than half a day. After determining the replacement parts to repair my broken machine took me well along to the cost of a new one I started shopping. I am an Amazon fan. Right to my door and I recently added Prime. So very glad I did that finally. This microwave was here in 2 days. Free shipping too. I have as little patience with online shopping as I do going into the stores. So.... when I wanted to get a micro quickly I started the search online. This one matched my criteria and it was one of only a few that did. I wanted at least 1200 watts and larger square foot capacity inside the machine than many other micro's offer. And the same size overall so it would fit where the old one lived. No wiggle room there. Most others I found did not have the size or power of this one or the ratings. And in the new age of products that always impress me as nothing more than cheap junk it is no surprise ratings are so mixed making it hard to make a decision to buy.  In the short time we have been using it we have had no problems. But comparing it to the one it replaced I took a star away and maybe should have taken two. The basics I did with the old one are not able to be selected on the panel as I am accustomed to doing. This annoys me. I can keep the users guide handy and retrain myself but do not understand why I have to. I am thoroughly fed up with upgrades and updates and improvements to things I use that in reality make them harder, more complicated and time consuming to use and require retraining for the more complicated operation. I do not consider that an improvement and it has become a pet peeve. That little rant over with. The sensor reheat and sensor cook functions are new tech for me and I do like them. No more guessing times and power levels.  And what use I havemade of them has turned out fine. But compared to the last one this is not easy no brainer button pushing. And where it loses the stars.

So to wrap this up and be of help to you I will say: This was the best I found in this size at this price point. I do like the new technology it uses. It certainly improves cooking with one. Much better results. I have not used the defrost which is also new tech to me. No reason to think it won't work as stated and is better tech than the old. You can program multi functions at the beginning so it can be left and will adjust the cook time and power levels on its own. No need to tend to it as we used to have to do. The user guide was concise and I have had no trouble using it. I have found an answer for every question I have had so far. A great micro and I am happy with my choice and the new ( to me) technology it has. Really does give great results with less fuss.

Add actual shopping time and this never takes less than half a day. After determining the replacement parts to repair my broken machine took me well along to the cost of a new one I started shopping. I am an Amazon fan. Right to my door and I recently added Prime. So very glad I did that finally. This microwave was here in 2 days. Free shipping too. I have as little patience with online shopping as I do going into the stores. So.... when I wanted to get a micro quickly I started the search online. This one matched my criteria and it was one of only a few that did. I wanted at least 1200 watts and larger square foot capacity inside the machine than many other micro's offer. And the same size overall so it would fit where the old one lived. No wiggle room there. Most others I found did not have the size or power of this one or the ratings. And in the new age of products that always impress me as nothing more than cheap junk it is no surprise ratings are so mixed making it hard to make a decision to buy.  In the short time we have been using it we have had no problems. But comparing it to the one it replaced I took a star away and maybe should have taken two. The basics I did with the old one are not able to be selected on the panel as I am accustomed to doing. This annoys me. I can keep the users guide handy and retrain myself but do not understand why I have to.

and it does - just be aware that adding instant coffee, sugar, artificial sweetener, or creamer will probably cause a boil over.Waiting 30 or 40 seconds allows enough time for the cup to loose some of its glow.Also, Popcorn is a bit of a mystery for this critter.It pops popcorn just fine.It's just that it doesn't do well - automatically - or with the recommended manual settings.Either my popcorn is too cheap, the wrong sized bag, - or, popcorn is some thing totally different in Japan.Whatever you try for the first time, keep an eye on it.This thing can carbonize a bag a popcorn in a heart beat.One really neat thing is the Inverter technology.This critter doesn`t cycle on and off to average out reduced power levels.If you ask for 90% power, you get 90% power - all the time.It lacks the plethora of specialty buttons (it does have one for popcorn).The potatoe(s) button, fresh vegetables, thawing/defrost buttons, etc. are not up on the key pad.The functions are still there.They are buried down in multi-step menu operations.It takes a bitg of getting use to - but, it's no worse than an ipod, ipad, smartphone, smartTV, etc.I liked the idiot buttons.I don`t appreciate the challenge of a treasure hunt, poking around the menus searching for a special function knowledge nugget.Plus, unless you`ve memorized the  menu structure, one tends to go a step too far.This can result in a start over -cuz, not all paths allow back steps.I'm not sure if they call it Genius because the machine is supposed to be smart - or, because the operator has to be that smart.Summary:It is well made.It has worked well, to date.It uses less power.It delivers more power.It performs all nominal tasks, thru a slightly different user interface.It is not the cheapest microwave for its power level or volumne capacity.You can easily find a less expensive microwave -

46640176,R15811BBIROZ6Y,B0009KMYDW,4.0,0.0,0.0,Y,Works good,"Likes:<br /> cooks evenly, the best of any microwave I have used.  I credit part of it to the inverter technology.  What this means is that on reduced power settings (anything under max power) the oven puts out a steady, but reduced output.  Most microwaves reduce the power by cycling the magnetron 'off and on' to reduce the power, so you get bursts of full power, with a moment of no power.  The steady, but reduced power seems to provide for more even cooking.  For just boiling a cup of water on 'high' you won't notice.  However, try warming a couple slices of pizza at half power compared to our old microwave, also at half power, and it is heated much more evenly.  I quite often use reduced power settings, as it tends to heat food up more evenly, even if it does take a little longer.  This microwave shines in that category.  Also, it defrosts meat without 'browning' it, far better and faster than any other I have had.<br /><br />Controls easy to figure out:  Once you figure out where the buttons are, working the oven is very straightforward.  There is a chart inside the door opening, that tells you what foods correspond to each number.  You just look at the chart, find what you are cooking, and program accordingly.  One comment I might make, is that whenever you use the auto-cook mode, it gives the option of 'more' or 'less', and for me at least, the 'less' choice is the one to use.  I like to use a spatter cover, so that may have something to do with it.  About the only gripe I have, is that to program in food number 4, you don't press 'program' and then the '4' button, but rather press the 'program' button 4 times.  It works OK, but thought I'd mention it.<br /><br />No obnoxious 'BLEEP' when food is done.  Finally, a microwave, that lets me pop popcorn, or heat something up after putting the kids to bed, that won't wake up a light sleeper.  Just a series of 5 beeps, not much louder than the beeps you hear when pressing the buttons to operate the oven.  It beeps 5times again maybe once or twice a minute, until you open the oven.  I also like that the display says 'enjoy your meal' when it is done, and scrolls across the screen.  Even without my glasses on, I can tell from across the room if it is done, by the movement of the scrolling letters, as opposed to the 'end' that our old microwave would display.<br /><br />Space/shape:  The shape is more 'square' than 'rectangle' which allows things like a large pizza box to rotate inside, rather than getting hung up.  It probably has the most usable space inside, compared to its size outside, of any microwave I have seen<br /><br />Dislikes: cannot disable turntable:  Every other microwave we have owned with a turntable, had a little roller mechanism that engaged the drive hub, and carried the turntable.  If you had something that wouldn't turn inside, you just lifted up the table, removed the little roller/hub mechanism, and the plate was stationary on the bottom of the oven.  This one has the drive hub engage the turntable directly, so unless you physically put something underneath it (you can use a large microwave safe dish) the drive hub is always trying to 'grab' the lugs formed into the turntable itself.  The problem with raising it up, means you have that much less space.  It is not that big a deal, as it may only be an issue once in a great while, if at all, but thought it worth mentioning.<br /><br />Minor quibfle with programming.  It is simple, and straightforward, but takes a lot of button presses.  For example, the 'power level' button reduces the power 10% every time it is pressed.  So, if you want to heat something at half power, you press 'power', 'power', 'power', 'power', 'power', 'power'.  I would prefer to hit 'power' '5', like on our old oven.

After much research I settled on this model because it fit the space we had available, looked simple to operate and, got good  reviews. I've had it for over a year and can say without reservation that I'm happy with this microwave. I don't use many of the cooking options--just straight minutes or, a feature which I love, the quick minute button. It feels very sturdy, though it's not built like my Sharp tank, especially the top, which is definitely thinner. But it's also more powerful than what I'd been used to, which means I had to adjust to faster cooking times (a good change), and it's much lighter, making it easier to move out for cleaning the counter underneath and behind. I'm giving it four stars only because, though I've had it for over a year, it seems premature to say it's perfect. But if it's still working in three years I'll come back and edit. In the meantime, based on a year's experience, I can definitely recommend it. Edit: 4-14-16. I still love it!

13722260,R56ADPZCO7G90,B0009KMYDM,5.0,2.0,2.0,Y,Great microwave,"I like making chips in my microwave and my old microwave could not do it with the chip maker (it would cut off and have to cool down since it took so long).  I got this since it seemed to be the largest wattage microwave I could find for consumers.  Plus it was not that expensive!<br /><br />I have tried out some of the features of this microwave (it has a lot and some I might not ever use, but the Sensor feature is great and I will be using it).  I put in a potato (russet) and chose the sensor cook for potato.  It started up and in 2.75 minutes the potato was done (the microwave stopped; it says sensor for a while and than it will put a countdown when it is about done).  The potato was delicious and cooked perfectly (the skin just came right off and the inside was just perfect!!!).<br /><br />I tried boiling water to see how long it would take.  It took about 3 minutes to get 3 cups of water (testing in a Pyrex measuring cup) to 200 degrees (I measured with a thermometer).  Also, once the boil started it kept a rapid boil and did not lose the boil or boil over (I used it yesterday to boil some rice (the rice in a bag) in a measuring cup for quick rice!)<br /><br />My chips are one of the toughest things to cook in a microwave (it is chip maker that slices the potato (or apple!) and you put it on the trays and microwave.  My old microwave could only do one tray at a time (you can stack up to three trays supposedly), and it took about 5 minutes for each tray and it would overheat and stop working.  I tried this microwave with all three trays and it only took 3.5 minutes to cook all three trays perfectly!  The chips were all crisp and cooked perfectly and knocked off 12 minutes of microwaving that I normally had to do!  Also, the microwave had no problem and did not cut off or anything!<br /><br />The microwave is humongous!  You could fit a normal size turkey in it (the kind that you buy at the supermarket in the white bags) - I do not think you would cook a turkey in a microwave, but I guess you could defrost... I would not, but I just wanted to give you an idea of cavity size.  The nice size makes it suitable for any tasks and you do not have to worry about if it will fit.<br /><br />The tray turns nicely and seems to turn faster than my older unit.  The fan on the side blows out warm (not hot) air, so I think it can be near another appliance (I have it next to my fridge) without causing any issues (I have room so it can breathe).<br /><br />The unit is pushed against the wall behind it, and that helps with the door, which is a tad hard, but not that bad (harder to open/close than my old one).  However, with the wall behind it you do not notice this and pushing the button and closing the door do not feel any different than other units.<br /><br />In the settings you can set a reminder beep (this one beeps a single beep ever 30 seconds (I think, I did not count)).  I turned this on since I sometimes forget, I also can hear the beeps in the other room so something that takes a long time can be left and I can go watch some TV and hear it when it goes off (assuming the TV is not too loud).  The beep seems normal to me.<br /><br />The microwave is elegant and the picture does not do it justice.  The buttons are silver toned and look really classy.  The door screen does have lines going across, but you can still see the food in it when you are cooking.  The display is green and can be seen easily, I will admit that it is a deeper set display, and my cabinets are at my waist and standing next to the microwave does hide the top of the display (for example a 7 might look like a 1), but if you look down a little or stand back you can see it fine (if you are shorter you would not have this problem (this also varies based on your cabinet height).  The display also shows the power and is really nice and easy to understand (it does talk a lot (display scrolls through text), you can change how fast it goes through text if you want by goingto settings.<br /><br />Also, the keep warm feature is awesome (sensor is cooler, but this comes in a close second), it allows you to keep food warm while working on other dishes, which is super useful.<br /><br />In the end I am very happy with this microwave.  It is the best microwave I have ever owned!  It is super powerful (I do have to shorten time for microwave dinners, which is OK), and is super large.  It was a great buy and just works amazingly!  The features are great and the Keep Warm and Sensor are so great that I will be using them quite often.  In the past I never used defrost, since it never worked that well, however, I will definitely be using it on this unit since it works great, so on days when I forget to set out the meat I can just defrost it in here and not worry about trying to find something else for dinner!

The door screen does have lines going across, but you can still see the food in it when you are cooking.  The display is green and can be seen easily, I will admit that it is a deeper set display, and my cabinets are at my waist and standing next to the microwave does hide the top of the display (for example a 7 might look like a 1), but if you look down a little or stand back you can see it fine (if you are shorter you would not have this problem (this also varies based on your cabinet height).  The display also shows the power and is really nice and easy to understand (it does talk a lot (display scrolls through text), you can change how fast it goes through text if you want by goingto settings.Also, the keep warm feature is awesome (sensor is cooler, but this comes in a close second), it allows you to keep food warm while working on other dishes, which is super useful.In the end I am very happy with this microwave.  It is the best microwave I have ever owned!  It is super powerful (I do have to shorten time for microwave dinners, which is OK), and is super large.  It was a great buy and just works amazingly!  The features are great and the Keep Warm and Sensor are so great that I will be using them quite often.  In the past I never used defrost, since it never worked that well, however, I will definitely be using it on this unit since it works great, so on days when I forget to set out the meat I can just defrost it in here and not worry about trying to find something else for dinner!

15889481,R39LYDKL4PBNQ2,B0009KMYDM,3.0,1.0,1.0,Y,Possibly defective unit - problems with door,"I got this microwave last month and so far have had a couple major problems with it. Like other's have said, the door on this thing is hard to open. You will need both hands as pushing the button does not  pop it open like on a normal microwave. Every so often, the door will get stuck when trying to open it, forcing you to push it shut and try again.<br /><br />This leads to some problems. If the door jams when opening it, it has the potential to dislodge some safety switch in the door, preventing the microwave from operating. It will start the countdown, but the magnetron won't engage, and it will shut off within a couple of seconds.<br /><br />This has happened on many occasions and it takes a little finesse with a butter knife or flathead screwdriver to ever-so-slightly pry up the inside bezel near the spokes in hopes it will re-align the safety switch. Before I realized that was the problem and found a decent solution, I thought it was broken and was extremely frustrated. I am still considering returning it for something that doesn't have this problem.<br /><br />When the microwave does decide to work, it does a pretty good job. Like other's have mentioned, it is loud. Not like super loud, but it's definitely louder than any other microwave. Doesn't bother me though. The inverter is a beast when thawing meat...where every other microwave you ran the risk of partially cooking it in some spots, this thing does not have that problem at all.<br /><br />Other than that, it does what any other microwave does...but faster (at the cost of using more electricity).",2013-08-31,280,"I got this microwave last month and so far have had a couple major problems with it.

I was told the nearest service station was a TV and Video repair place 116 miles away.  No problem except I am expected to pay the shipping as Panasonic's policy is to only pay shipping one way.<br /><br />I replied that I should not have to bear the cost of shipping for repair of a defective product.  I asked the courteous young lady to speak to someone who had the authority to make an exception to the policy and was put on hold for several minutes.  She came back on line to say she couldn't locate a supervisor and please hold again.  Several minutes later I was told no supervisor was available and that someone would get back to me between 24 and 48 hours.<br /><br />When I protested that I shouldn't have to wait that long she said that if I replied to a survey that someone would call me back within thirty minutes.  I said someone should be able to call me back within thirty minutes whether I responded to the survey or not but that didn't work.  So now I am waiting for a call back.<br /><br />As of now I would not recommend this product; it offers nothing that a cheaper model doesn't, won't accept the best popcorn popper I ever used, and other than a courteous phone representative, Panasonic customer service does not deserve positive comment.

I now have to push the button twice before it will open.  I fear this function will be gone in only a matter of time.<br /><br />The inverter technology is interesting.  It does defrost better than a regular microwave, but only if you place the food just right on the plate (the instruction manual tells you how to do this).  It will sometimes cook the edges of food during defrost, but not nearly as much as a microwave without the inverter technology.  And it's not like you can stick the food in and be done with it until the timer goes off.  You still have to watch it. For instance, if defrosting ground beef, the manual instructs you to stop the microwave and shave off the outer parts that are defrosted.  Well...I did that with my old microwave.  So not sure about the hoopla with the inverter technology.<br /><br />The space in the microwave is great.  I fit a 13 x 9 in casserole dish in there and it rotated with no problem.  The depth is much larger than the height.  Our old microwave (which was about the same cubic feet) had much more height and less depth which worked for us because we were able to put tall glasses or bottles in there.

There was no way I was getting near that thing after that. So we started to look for a replacement.<br /><br />We selected this Panasonic one mainly because of the good reviews for it here on Amazon, the price, and the size. It's super big on the inside. I was concerned that it might not fit our countertop, but it's actually just a little bigger than our old, medium-sized one. That's kind of surprising, because it is significantly bigger on the inside.<br /><br />So here are the things I love about this microwave oven:<br /><br />* Although it's huge on the inside, it's as big as most medium-sized microwaves on the outside.<br />* It defrosts things fairly easily. You just press the \\""Inverter/Turbo Defrost\\"" button, enter the item's weight in pounds, and press \\""Start.\\""<br />* The \\""Sensor Reheat\\"" button is great for when you don't want to figure out how long something should be microwaved. One press, and it figures it out for you. It does tend to make things a little hotter than I like, but I still love this feature.<br /><br />And here are the things I don't like about it:<br />* Although it has a \\""Popcorn\\"" button, all other automatic items work with the \\""Sensor Cook\\"" button, which you have to press multiple times to get to the item you want, and you have to know what's on that list and what isn't to begin with. Potato, for example, is number six (I think).<br />* The \\""Function\\"" button is equally confusing. When you press it, it asks you to make a selection by pressing 0-9. It doesn't explain what any of these are.<br />* The door is large and hinges on the left, which in our kitchen means it swings far out over the sink.<br /><br />Why do we love this microwave so much? It takes the guesswork out of defrosting and reheating. No more defrosted ground beef with microwave \\""burnt\\"" edges. No more reheated dishes that are too hot on the edges and too cold in the middle. It does what it's supposed to do, what you WANT a microwave to do.<br /><br />So seven months have passed, and ours is still working very well, but now the reviews on Amazon aren't as consistently great as they were when we bought it. Some here are saying that theirs have broken within a year or two. That worries me. I'll try to remember to update this review if we run into any problems, but so far so good.

11512778,RW6S4M59YHZ4L,B0009KMYDW,2.0,0.0,0.0,Y,Love the sensor cook!,"I do a lot of bulk cooking and freezing, and the prior microwave we had was not the best for defrosting food. Parts would be too hot while others still cold. Now all I have to do is hit &#34;Sensor Cook&#34; on this microwave and it's done! I don't even have to think about it. It doesn't matter how frozen something is, it gets it right every time. I have tested it on frozen soups, frozen casseroles, frozen beans, frozen tortilla shells, frozen veggie meals, and frozen pasta. Perfect, perfect, perfect. Also, I love how easy it is to change the power level down to cook perfect potatoes. My last microwave was difficult to do that with. I can't wait to try out squashes next! The quick minute option heats up food REALLY fast so use that carefully! I came out with some ridiculously hot food with that button.  It's a big microwave, I can fit all my big pyrex glass cookware in there which is really helpful!  So far I haven't had any mechanical issues. If I do have any issues I will definitely update the review, but if you see nothing that means it is still working perfectly!  UPDATE: After 3 years the door hinge broke on it and the button no longer works to open the door. Cheap latches! I have read up on the issue and this is a known issue for this microwave! What a waste of money! I don't know about you guys but I expect a microwave to last longer than 3 years. I have moved on to a commercial microwave which has been way better so far. Avoid the push button models!",2013-06-06,280,"I do a lot of bulk cooking and freezing, and the prior microwave we had was not the best for defrosting food. Parts would be too hot while others still cold. Now all I have to do is hit ""Sensor Cook"" on this microwave and it's done! I don't even have to think about it. It doesn't matter how frozen something is, it gets it right every time. I have tested it on frozen soups, frozen casseroles, frozen beans, frozen tortilla shells, frozen veggie meals, and frozen pasta. Perfect, perfect, perfect. Also, I love how easy it is to change the power level down to cook perfect potatoes. My last microwave was difficult to do that with. I can't wait to try out squashes next! The quick minute option heats up food REALLY fast so use that carefully! I came out with some ridiculously hot food with that button.  It's a big microwave, I can fit all my big pyrex glass cookware in there which is really helpful!  So far I haven't had any mechanical issues. If I do have any issues I will definitely update the review, but if you see nothing that means it is still working perfectly!

She was trying to convince me that just because a toaster or lamp worked when plugged in to the outlets I tried, that does not mean the microwave would work in those same outlets. She recommended I hire an electrician to check out my house! After about 5 minutes on the phone, 5 minutes I will never get back, I hung up.I called Amazon back and they sent me a new one, next day delivery. They also sent a pre-paid UPS label so that I could send the old microwave back.I have been shopping at AMAZON for many years and EVERY TIME I have a problem, which is quite rare, they are AMAZING. I have nothing but praise for this company. I live in Hawaii where some products are almost impossible to get (without outrageous shipping costs). They are the first and most of the time the only place I shop when online.",decent amazing called asked contact care trust knew experience girl phone said electrical house outlet tested trying convince toaster lamp worked plugged outlet tried mean outlet recommended hire electrician check house minute phone minute hung called sent new delivery sent pre paid ups label send shopping time problem quite rare amazing praise company live hawaii impossible outrageous shipping cost time place shop online

It is a full size microwave with lots of power. I was surprised how large it was and it can hold a little over 15 inch plate.  No problem having to take the food out to cook and then placing on the plate, no having to tilt the plate neither.  Someone said in another review they couldn't watch the food cooking, not so, when the light comes on inside of the microwave, even though their is a ribbed looking outer surface, you can still see in the microwave the food cooking.  I had no problem, so I'm really surprised to have read that review before buying it.  I could see what I needed to, like the popcorn bag inflating and when it was actually popped, but you would know listening to the kernels popping anyway, when they slowed down to a few a second.  I really felt that was a little misleading.  Popcorn needed about 15 more seconds, but that was easy with the Quick minute using it for just a few and stopping it !

It is a full size microwave with lots of power. I was surprised how large it was and it can hold a little over 15 inch plate.  No problem having to take the food out to cook and then placing on the plate, no having to tilt the plate neither.  Someone said in another review they couldn't watch the food cooking, not so, when the light comes on inside of the microwave, even though their is a ribbed looking outer surface, you can still see in the microwave the food cooking.  I had no problem, so I'm really surprised to have read that review before buying it.  I could see what I needed to, like the popcorn bag inflating and when it was actually popped, but you would know listening to the kernels popping anyway, when they slowed down to a few a second.  I really felt that was a little misleading.  Popcorn needed about 15 more seconds, but that was easy with the Quick minute using it for just a few and stopping it !

Almost every weekend I buy Chinese Food, Pepper Steak, Shrimp Fried Rice and more for my brother and I.  The food never arrives hot enough for our tastes so we zap it with microwaves till piping hot!  We use this microwave to heat water for tea, coffee and more.  We defrost meat and use this Microwave often and it has just be a pure workhorse.  I did not spend much to purchase this microwave and it has more than delivered performance for the price I paid.  This microwave has out lived a Frigidaire Affinity Front Load Washer, Home Depot Florescent Light Fixtures (Cheap Ballasts)!  For me this Panasonic Microwave has paid for it self in use and dependibility.<br /><br />On May 7th 2010 I brought this Black, Panasonic NN-H765BF Genius 1.6 cuft 1250-Watt Sensor Microwave with Inverter Technology.  This Panasonic Microwave oven works fine for me.  As we speak I am heating up some shrimp fried rice using it.  After a long day at work last thing I want to do when arriving home is cook a full on dinner.  Lucky for me I live within walking distance of like 30 take away shops and all of them deliver.  Too often however the food arrives that legally safe lukewarm that insures no one will get burned and sue the place.  Problem I hate luke warm food.  I love my cold food cold and my hot food piping hot.  In my experience Microwave ovens are horrible at cooking most things from scratch.  In my experience what microwave ovens do best is heat things up fast while breathing new life into tired food with the caveat that it only works well once.  So for the cost of a bunch of electrons my luke warm take away shop dinner is now heated to truly HOT temperatures thanks to this Panasonic microwave I brought here at Amazon.com.<br /><br />I am here to tell you when I was a kid in the 1970's Panasonic was a name you could more than trust you could bank on it.  Almost anything Panasonic made was great and lasted for years of faithful use.  Like my youth the days of Panasonic products you could trust are long gone my friends.  Today buying any appliance is a crap shoot.  You might buy a treasure or you might buy a lemon.  The Panasonic Microwave I brought has been a treasure as reflected in my rating.  My Panasonic has been extremely gently used.  My Panasonic Microwave is lucky to be used 4 to 6 times a week but when used its always there.  This Panasonic Microwave like anything else made these days feels cheap in construction.  The plastic door has lots of flex give when you open and close it like a toy.  The door to this Panasonic Microwave flexes and gives so much you almost think it will break when opening the door.  The locking mechanism is also cheap so I am always careful to help open the door to this Panasonic microwave oven which should not be necessary but is.<br /><br />This Panasonic microwave oven is powerful and has enough space to do almost any basic reheat jobs.  This Panasonic microwave has nothing fancy, no real bells and whistles above basic features you would expect.  Panasonic's highest quality days are behind it based on my experience with its products.  I brought a Panasonic DVD player recorder that barely lasted 4 months so I believe all those reviews that suggest Panasonic quality is circling the bowl at warp speed.  I have to rate a product on my experiences with it.  I've had this Panasonic Microwave over for about two and a half years with all joys and no problems whatsoever.  However as I said buying any appliance today is a crap shoot at best.  Some of an appliance line works well while others fail.  I think in most industries the science and concept of quality control is in the toilet since most companies are only in it for a fast buck.  The crappy appliances we get now days is what we deserve for not holding companies to a higher quality standard.

I chose this one because of the price and the features like the minute button. We've had it for 4 days now and it's been super! Popcorn fine, reheating fine, cooking fine. I haven't defrosted yet but I'm optimistic. Hasn't caught on fire or popped my circuit breaker box either. It is a bit different from my Kenmore which preceeded it in that it's a little shorter, has a button to press to open the door, and I have to press Start after I press the minute button. I am NOT experiencing the radio or Wifi interference that others have. What I am getting used to is the position of the door opening button. It seems a bit low and is curved so that I have to hold my hand a certain way to open it comfortably. This however is not a biggie and certainly should not be a deal breaker. The window also feels lower, but I'm almost six feet tall so that may be a factor. I certainly can look in although there seems to be extra (I don't know what to call it) screening in the glass.

The performance has been outstanding.  Not yet pushed it to its limits, but for everyday stuff it's been flawless.  The power is more than adequate, food and drinks take a little less time to reach the same temp as the previous microwave.  I'm trusting the 'inverter' technology works.

Pretty sure it could be programmed to do this for me but I didn't take the time to look it up.  The display is easy to read, the instructions are fairly intuitive and the written resources that are included help clear up any questions.

Given an increase in space from 1.1 cu ft (last microwave) to 2.2 cu ft and an increase in features and usability, the price for this microwave is, in my opinion, worth it.  However, I will keep the warranty and receipt handy.  I have a file for that.

17646114,R3DBZCYVWZRG4P,B0009KMYGY,4.0,2.0,2.0,Y,Good Microwave with minor drawbacks,"Off the bat this microwave is larger than I expected it to be. That's more a pitfall of buying things like this online but I would double check any measurements to make sure you have enough room for it. It's a surprisingly large unit.<br /><br />Overall I'm satisfied. Compared to my last two microwaves this one heats food faster and seems to do a better job at heating things evenly. It has lots of advanced features that I mostly do not use but it's nice to have them there. I will say however that this is the best microwave I have ever owned when it comes to defrosting meat. It's almost shocking how much better it is than my last microwave. Gone are the days of pulling off defrosted portions of ground beef or turkey so that they do not overcook while still defrosting the center. I can freeze ground meat in the package, place the frozen slab on a plate and have the entire thing defrost (with flipping) without any parts overheating. It's fantastic.<br /><br />There are minor annoyances though. The quick minute button doesn't start the microwave. You still have to push start. Also, the kitchen timer is nearly useless unless you remain in the kitchen. When it's finished it gives off a couple of quiet little beeps and that's it. If you didn't hear it the first time you're out of luck.<br /><br />I also tried to use the sensor reheat function, where the microwave automatically senses the temperature of the food and reheats it properly but it almost always overheats whatever I put in there. It senses the moisture/steam coming off whatever is on the plate, not the actual temperature, and can be easily fooled by covers or paper towels meant to keep the inside clean. Even when using the &#34;less&#34; setting food is often overheated. Be prepared to ruin vegetables if you go this route for heating food.<br /><br />With that said, I'd definitely buy it again if I had to. It's been both reliable and efficient as well as being an overall positive addition to my kitchen.",2012-12-24,353,"Off the bat this microwave is larger than I expected it to be.

I sat it on two different surfaces, and get the same rocking motion - my old microwave didn't rock back and forth sitting in the same place.

It's almost impossible to see inside, even when the light is on.

Their only purpose is to make it so you can't see if your pizza has melted into a puddle or not.<br /><br />If I ever get to the point of turning it on, I'll update this review with how it actually works (or doesn't as the case may be).<br /><br />Overall, poor quality in the build of this.

49825252,R3KIPGK933AL1Q,B0009KMYDW,4.0,0.0,0.0,Y,Super Power - but Died After Only 3yrs Light Use,"Cautionary UPDATE 6/18/2015: A few days ago my unit, purchased in April 2012, died. It lasted a mere 3yrs. The door latch suddenly failed w/o any prior warning. Sadly, now it's just a giant, overpriced, paperweight. For this reason, I have reduced my rating from 5 stars to 4. I loved this microwave while it was working but feel that it should have lasted longer than 3yrs. I only used it to warm things and occasionally defrost. I didn't use it for cooking. No heavy use.   It works. It fits fine on my counter. The interior is HUGE. It's quite powerful. Most things are done in less than the stated time. I've found that I need to reduce stated cooking time for frozen dinners by 1-2min, for instance.  When considering this purchase, I was concerned about whether I would need to learn a lot of special instructions to use it even for very basic things. Most of the time I use the microwave to heat left overs and frozen dinners. I would have been unhappy if I needed to consult an instruction book or learn a lot of cryptic stuff to do something so simple. Actually, I find the unit very user friendly. Basic commands are much like those for other units and are quite intuitive. If you just want to do basic cooking at full power, say to heat a meal for 3min, for instance, it's as simple as pushing '3' '0' '0' and the start button, just like most other units.  So far, in addition to warming things, I've used the unit at reduced power levels, defrosted meat based on weight, and used the sensor for warming and cooking, all without reading the instruction booklet. I found most commands very intuitive. When I was unsure what to do next, the scrolling instructions on the control panel did a great job of telling me what I needed to know, basically walking me through the steps, telling me, for instance, to punch in weight in ounces (for defrosting). (Note: there is a setup menu which allows you to choose whether you want to use metric vs standard and other preferences.)  Defrosting meatworked extremely well. Both pork chops and chicken defrosted nicely w/o cooking even at the edges. Things cook extremely well in this unit with everything on the plate cooking evenly, no hot and cold spots. Popcorn pops more reliably with all but a very few kernels popped, nothing scorched.  A few reviewers noted that the scrolling words (instructions) on the front panel moved too slowly for them. While I find the default setting works fine for me, the setup menu allows you to customize the speed at which the words scroll by. You can speed them up or slow them down, whatever works for you.  So far, I'm very happy with this purchase. It does everything I want it to do; it has some nice extras; it's easy to use; and the front panel prompts you when you don't know what to do next. I've not had any problems with it so far. I don't find it to be any nosier than my old unit, and I've not experienced any problems with wifi interruption (as some reviewers did). I've only had it for a month or two, so I can't speak to the issue others have raised about longevity of the product (many say it only lasts about a year). I'll try to remember to return later with an update on that.",2012-05-16,583,"Cautionary UPDATE 6/18/2015: A few days ago my unit, purchased in April 2012, died. It lasted a mere 3yrs.

So far, in addition to warming things, I've used the unit at reduced power levels, defrosted meat based on weight, and used the sensor for warming and cooking, all without reading the instruction booklet. I found most commands very intuitive. When I was unsure what to do next, the scrolling instructions on the control panel did a great job of telling me what I needed to know, basically walking me through the steps, telling me, for instance, to punch in weight in ounces (for defrosting). (Note: there is a setup menu which allows you to choose whether you want to use metric vs standard and other preferences.)  Defrosting meatworked extremely well. Both pork chops and chicken defrosted nicely w/o cooking even at the edges. Things cook extremely well in this unit with everything on the plate cooking evenly, no hot and cold spots. Popcorn pops more reliably with all but a very few kernels popped, nothing scorched.  A few reviewers noted that the scrolling words (instructions) on the front panel moved too slowly for them. While I find the default setting works fine for me, the setup menu allows you to customize the speed at which the words scroll by. You can speed them up or slow them down, whatever works for you.  So far, I'm very happy with this purchase. It does everything I want it to do; it has some nice extras; it's easy to use; and the front panel prompts you when you don't know what to do next. I've not had any problems with it so far. I don't find it to be any nosier than my old unit, and I've not experienced any problems with wifi interruption (as some reviewers did). I've only had it for a month or two, so I can't speak to the issue others have raised about longevity of the product (many say it only lasts about a year).

35822371,ROX4334Q2GK8Q,B0009KMYDW,3.0,0.0,0.0,N,two-year update,"3/13/14<br /><br />I've had it two years. The microwave is not working most of the time now. The light will sometimes stay on after you close the door, and the time starts going with no microwave power. The timer quits after a few seconds. The door seems loose. Maybe that is why it's not working. Vertical movement in the door as you close it. That moved my rating down from 5 stars to 3. It,  should last 5 or more years, for ages, really. But since you can hardly get one to last three months these days, I'll leave it up at 3 stars. Yeesh. Now I have to see if the service policy is any good, if it's even still in effect.<br /><br />4/3/12 Update<br /><br />As mentioned below, I purchased this microwave (Best Buy), and it did not work/sound properly. I hoped it was just a dud, and exchanged it for a black model of the same microwave. So far, knock wood, it is working well. I am happy with the size (for my family of three) and the features. You can heat a whole 9 x 12 dish in it. If you need that, it's great. I use the power function, quick minute, and timer in addition to regular 100% power heating. Its heating power is strong. So I am happy that I appear to have a working one now. I hope that it will last as long as the one I got for my parents (same model). Just in case, I bought the service policy, which I highly recommend for electronics like this and TVs. Since things are made so poorly now, I am sure that it is worth it. I wouldn't have said this 10 years ago, but now I highly recommend the policies.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />First of all, I must take time for a little rant on how difficult it is to find a countertop microwave in local stores. Please forgive me. You can skip. HHGregg had about 5-6. None were Panasonic. Sears had about 5. None were Panasonic. Home Depot and Lowes had fewer microwaves than that. None were Panasonic. Kohl's had two. I didn't expect many there, but two? They were both poorly rated microwaves, not Panasonic, and too small. I called around to other stores, including independents. They didn't carry Panasonic. One said it was \\""a GE shop.\\"" Most of these I had checked online before going, and Panasonic was available online. But not in the store when I went. Why is it so hard to find and buy a good microwave in a physical store? I hesitate to order online because they are so fragile. I mean, really, the new ones I got locally don't even work. So how would something ship safely to my home? Sheesh.<br /><br />This Panasonic microwave was the best rated for my needs although the problems reported in the negative reviews are only too likely to happen. So I took a chance and bought this one at Best Buy (a store I hate). It is identical, as far as I can tell, to the one I bought my parents several years ago, in microwave years. It worked well for them and then for me until recently when it burnt out (electric smell all over the house, no more heating). I don't know if it is our fault (for not setting the turntable properly) or if its time had come. It worked well until then. It then started making a worrying noise and finally gave up the ghost with the smell and such.<br /><br />Right out of the box, I was pleased with this Panasonic's size, familiar features, etc. Unlike others, the clock is easy for me to see because we have a built-in shelf that is chest to head high. Unfortunately, the microwave has made a buzzing noise towards the end and after cooking since we got it. I don't notice it every time, but I don't know if that is because it is not there or because I am not paying attention. They should replace it with no problem. Based on all of the reviews, I also bought the three-year protection plan.<br /><br />However, another small rant, why can you no longer buy a microwave, and have it work out of the box???<br /><br />This is the second Panasonic I've bought in the last couple weeks. The first was at Target. It was not to be found on Amazon with that particular model number. This may be due to what I've heard about big box retailers. If they demand a certain price point, the manufacturer has to produce one for that to sell at their stores. The items therefore have lower quality or less expensive parts or something. I don't know if that comes into this, but I expect it does. When we took it out of the box, it made an arcing noise after cooking. This definitely did not seem safe. I took it back. It was the last one Target had. I guess that was a bad omen. It was old and they hadn't reordered.<br /><br />After that, I bought a GE Profile at HHGregg before I checked the reviews. I was desperate for a microwave, and nobody seemed to have any I wanted. Bad move though. Living without a microwave is tough nowadays, but even so. Before I opened it at home, however, I checked the reviews. It was rated so poorly that I didn't even open the box. I took it back.

The microwave is not working most of the time now. The light will sometimes stay on after you close the door, and the time starts going with no microwave power. The timer quits after a few seconds. The door seems loose. Maybe that is why it's not working. Vertical movement in the door as you close it. That moved my rating down from 5 stars to 3. It,  should last 5 or more years, for ages, really. But since you can hardly get one to last three months these days, I'll leave it up at 3 stars. Yeesh. Now I have to see if the service policy is any good, if it's even still in effect.4/3/12 UpdateAs mentioned below, I purchased this microwave (Best Buy), and it did not work/sound properly. I hoped it was just a dud, and exchanged it for a black model of the same microwave. So far, knock wood, it is working well. I am happy with the size (for my family of three) and the features. You can heat a whole 9 x 12 dish in it. If you need that, it's great. I use the power function, quick minute, and timer in addition to regular 100% power heating. Its heating power is strong. So I am happy that I appear to have a working one now. I hope that it will last as long as the one I got for my parents (same model). Just in case, I bought the service policy, which I highly recommend for electronics like this and TVs. Since things are made so poorly now, I am sure that it is worth it. I wouldn't have said this 10 years ago, but now I highly recommend the policies.Original review:First of all, I must take time for a little rant on how difficult it is to find a countertop microwave in local stores. Please forgive me. You can skip. HHGregg had about 5-6. None were Panasonic. Sears had about 5. None were Panasonic. Home Depot and Lowes had fewer microwaves than that. None were Panasonic. Kohl's had two. I didn't expect many there, but two? They were both poorly rated microwaves, not Panasonic, and too small. I called around to other stores, including independents. They didn't carry Panasonic. One said it was \\""a GE shop.\\"" Most of these I had checked online before going, and Panasonic was available online. But not in the store when I went. Why is it so hard to find and buy a good microwave in a physical store? I hesitate to order online because they are so fragile. I mean, really, the new ones I got locally don't even work. So how would something ship safely to my home? Sheesh.This Panasonic microwave was the best rated for my needs although the problems reported in the negative reviews are only too likely to happen. So I took a chance and bought this one at Best Buy (a store I hate). It is identical, as far as I can tell, to the one I bought my parents several years ago, in microwave years. It worked well for them and then for me until recently when it burnt out (electric smell all over the house, no more heating). I don't know if it is our fault (for not setting the turntable properly) or if its time had come. It worked well until then. It then started making a worrying noise and finally gave up the ghost with the smell and such.Right out of the box, I was pleased with this Panasonic's size, familiar features, etc. Unlike others, the clock is easy for me to see because we have a built-in shelf that is chest to head high. Unfortunately, the microwave has made a buzzing noise towards the end and after cooking since we got it. I don't notice it every time, but I don't know if that is because it is not there or because I am not paying attention. They should replace it with no problem. Based on all of the reviews, I also bought the three-year protection plan.However, another small rant, why can you no longer buy a microwave, and have it work out of the box???This is the second Panasonic I've bought in the last couple weeks. The first was at Target. It was not to be found on Amazon with that particular model number. This may be due to what I've heard about big box retailers. If they demand a certain price point, the manufacturer has to produce one for that to sell at their stores. The items therefore have lower quality or less expensive parts or something. I don't know if that comes into this, but I expect it does. When we took it out of the box, it made an arcing noise after cooking. This definitely did not seem safe. I took it back. It was the last one Target had. I guess that was a bad omen. It was old and they hadn't reordered.After that, I bought a GE Profile at HHGregg before I checked the reviews. I was desperate for a microwave, and nobody seemed to have any I wanted. Bad move though. Living without a microwave is tough nowadays, but even so. Before I opened it at home, however, I checked the reviews. It was rated so poorly that I didn't even open the box. I took it back. It was the last one at the store also.Each of these things added up to make days and days of no microwave. And now this *latest* new one does not work. I give it three stars only because of the first one and because of the features and ease of use. Hopefully I just got a dud. And I don't know what else to get.

We felt three years was outrageously short and set out to find one with great reviews for longevity. It turns out, after reading the reviews of pretty much every microwave offered in this size/wattage range on Amazon, they ALL have reviews saying that some of them died after a short period of time. We have come to the conclusion that the microwaves of today are simply not the ones our parents bought in the 80's that lasted 20 years. In fairness, this was also before there were so many microwaveable items available (easy mac, lean cuisine, 90 second rice...) and before the microwave had such a central role to play in practically every meal prepared in most households today. After reading the reviews for this microwave (including looking to Consumer Reports which also recommends this one) we decided it seemed to be the best. Further, it comes with the Good Housekeeping seal of approval which means they tested it and they guarantee it (and will replace it if it fails in under a certain amount of time). This microwave is nice looking. Complaints of it being too loud or the alarm being too soft are unfounded and frankly, kind of anal. It sounds like a microwave people -- period. The defrost seems to work well (which is important because I cook a great deal and regularly find myself defrosting meat or something else). The other functions work well too, including the one that warms leftovers. We've only been using it a short time so if something earth shattering happens we'll update the review. However, so far, this appears to be a very nice microwave, nice looking and works well for a family that uses it to both cook and reheat items multiple times a day. At this fantastic low price, if it only lasts us 3 to 5 years -- we'll be happy. Oh -- and one last thing: nobody mentioned in their review whether or not a 9 x 13 pan or large casserole dish could fit into this microwave. I use the microwave to cook perfect stuffed peppers, to cook whole ears of corn on the cobb, etc. I needed to be sure it would fit cookware and it does -- with room to spare. Don't hesitate or worry too much about this microwave. It's a sound purchase and gets the job done.    UPDATE: This microwave died after one year nearly to the date. We were of course angry about that because it's unfair to pay this kind of money for something that lasts just a year. We decided to go in search of another microwave. We read tons of reviews and finally got a Kenmore. We hated it. I missed the defrost option from this Panasonic so much and the ease of use. I just loved it.

So how would something ship safely to my home? Sheesh.<br /><br />This Panasonic microwave was the best rated for my needs although the problems reported in the negative reviews are only too likely to happen. So Itook a chance and bought this one at Best Buy (a store I hate). It is identical, as far as I can tell, to the one I bought my parents several years ago, in microwave years. It worked well for them and then for me until recently when it burnt out (electric smell all over the house, no more heating).

The first was at Target. It was not to be found on Amazon with that particular model number. This may be due to what I've heard about big box retailers. If they demand a certain price point, the manufacturer has to produce one for that to sell at their stores. The items therefore have lower quality or less expensive parts or something. I don't know if that comes into this, but I expect it does. When we took it out of the box, it made an arcing noise after cooking. This definitely did not seem safe. I took it back. It was the last one Target had. I guess that was a bad omen. It was old and they hadn't reordered.<br /><br />After that, I bought a GE Profile at HHGregg before I checked the reviews. I was desperate for a microwave, andnobody seemed to have any I wanted. Bad move though. Living without a microwave is tough nowadays, but even so. Before I opened it at home, however, I checked the reviews. It was rated so poorly that I didn't even open the box. I took it back. It was the last one at the store also.<br /><br />Each of these things added up to make days and days of no microwave. And now this *latest* new one does not work. I give it three stars only because of the first one and because of the features and ease of use. Hopefully I just got a dud. And I don't know what else to get. So hopefully they will get me another one that works. Until then, I will continue to use this one hoping that it is safe. Depending on the second one of these, I will get back on here and either downgrade to one or up to four.<br /><br /> Sheesh!",2012-02-28,914,"4/3/12 UpdateAs mentioned below, I purchased this microwave (Best Buy), and it did not work/sound properly. I hoped it was just a dud, and exchanged it for a black model of the same microwave. So far, knock wood, it is working well. I am happy with the size (for my family of three) and the features. You can heat a whole 9 x 12 dish in it. If you need that, it's great. I use the power function, quick minute, and timer in addition to regular 100% power heating. Its heating power is strong. So I am happy that I appear to have a working one now. I hope that it will last as long as the one I got for my parents (same model). Just in case, I bought the service policy, which I highly recommend for electronics like this and TVs. Since things are made so poorly now, I am sure that it is worth it. I wouldn't have said this 10 years ago, but now I highly recommend the policies.Original review:First of all, I must take time for a little rant on how difficult it is to find a countertop microwave in local stores. Please forgive me. You can skip. HHGregg had about 5-6. None were Panasonic. Sears had about 5. None were Panasonic. Home Depot and Lowes had fewer microwaves than that. None were Panasonic. Kohl's had two. I didn't expect many there, but two? They were both poorly rated microwaves, not Panasonic, and too small. I called around to other stores, including independents. They didn't carry Panasonic. One said it was \\""a GE shop.\\"" Most of these I had checked online before going, and Panasonic was available online. But not in the store when I went. Why is it so hard to find and buy a good microwave in a physical store? I hesitate to order online because they are so fragile. I mean, really, the new ones I got locally don't even work. So how would something ship safely to my home? Sheesh.This Panasonic microwave was the best rated for my needs although the problems reported in the negative reviews are only too likely to happen. So Itook a chance and bought this one at Best Buy (a store I hate). It is identical, as far as I can tell, to the one I bought my parents several years ago, in microwave years. It worked well for them and then for me until recently when it burnt out (electric smell all over the house, no more heating). I don't know if it is our fault (for not setting the turntable properly) or if its time had come. It worked well until then. It then started making a worrying noise and finally gave up the ghost with the smell and such.Right out of the box, I was pleased with this Panasonic's size, familiar features, etc. Unlike others, the clock is easy for me to see because we have a built-in shelf that is chest to head high.

Which brands give you the most features for the best price. How reliable are they, and what type of warranty do they carry? Microwaves are a particularly difficult appliance to buy, as there are distinct differences in types of microwaves available,counter top. over-oven, straight microwave, microwave /convection combo, with a browning element or without, food probes, as well as different price points, you get the picture.   Yes, this little appliance can be challenge. We recently replaced an eighteen year old Sharp microwave with a new microwave. In doing so, we did the usual research online and in the store. After several days of research, we found that one can buy a very good microwave, without breaking the bank. We opted for a counter top model, similar to our old one in size. We wanted to replace it with one that was large enough to be used not only to reheat meals, but also to cook meals in quickly. We decided not to get a combination convection and microwave oven, much more expensive to buy and maintain, as more things have to be fixed if something goes wrong. Besides, our regular oven does an excellent job of baking things quickly and efficiently.    After we settled on the size and type of microwave we wanted, we looked at the various brands, we compared features available and settled on the Panasonic NH765BF Full Size 1.6 Cubic Feet 1250 Watt Microwave oven, very reasonably priced, $117 including free shipping from Amazon. It has a quick and easy learning curve to operate it, great features such as inverter technology so food cooks, heats and defrosts evenly, (including a turbo defrost feature), Timer feature(kitchen timer/stand time/ delay start), sensor cook feature, sensor reheat feature, a popcorn feature and more. We have used our microwave for a little over a month now, and we have found the features on this oven to be both easy to use and time saving.    The Panasonic warranty also was a selling feature.This microwave oven enjoys a one year parts and labor, (except the Magnatron) and a five year MAGNATRON parts, one year labor warranty. This is a better warranty than other microwave brands, which are usually only one year.

The basic idea of using a switching power-supply is a good one - less shipping weight, more efficient etc.  The user interface is so-so - sensor reheat adds value to this unit. Forcing the user to push four buttons to start up a 1:10 heating is just lame. Much better would have been a rotary input that would increment by larger counts the faster it was pressed.  This could also be done with two push buttons - labeled plus and minus so a press increments 10 sec - press and hold an it starts to increment by 1min.  Not rocket science and a one time expense to develop.",light bulb user replaceable screw custom lamp requiring service replace failed early second wiring safety interlock cheap push connector make poor contact heated repair internal design poor circuit board make reliable costly quality push connector used 3rd class quality basic idea using switching power supply shipping weight efficient user interface sensor reheat add value forcing user push button start heating lame better rotary input increment larger count faster pressed push button labeled plus minus press increment sec press hold start increment 1min rocket science time expense develop

When it was functioning it was a great microwave but Panasonic has delivered the worst customer service I have ever experienced from a manufacturer.  Trust me, you do not want to have to deal with multiple phone calls to their 'support' center.    Requests to receive e-mail documentation of the phone calls and updates of the repair from the Phillipines-based support center have been ignored.

32425539,R2SZIRYNI1BGV9,B0009KMYHI,1.0,13.0,14.0,Y,Terrible Product - Don't Buy,I was initially pleased with this microwave until it quit working after four months of use.  I called Panasonic because it was still under warranty and they gave me a case number to have the microwave repaired.  It has been in the repair shop now for 4 weeks.  Try going 4 weeks without a microwave.  Wish I would have just bought a microwave from Wal-mart...at least I could have just returned it and gotten a new one.  Going through Panasonic warranty and repair shops is not worth the wait.  Its tough these days living without a microwave with a large family.  We have definitely made some changes and can't wait to finally get our microwave back.  I mean I wish I would just go buy another one somewhere else...but then eventually I would have 2 microwaves which I do not need. When speaking with Panasonic I couldn't help but to think they knew there was a problem with their product before they put it on the market.  I can't believe this is the quality coming from a Japanese company.  Can't believe they wouldn't just send me a new one rather than have me go to a repair shop.  Needless to say...I will not be purchasing another Panasonic Microwave.,2011-06-12,208,I was initially pleased with this microwave until it quit working after four months of use.  I called Panasonic because it was still under warranty and they gave me a case number to have the microwave repaired.  It has been in the repair shop now for 4 weeks.  Try going 4 weeks without a microwave.  Wish I would have just bought a microwave from Wal-mart...at least I could have just returned it and gotten a new one.  Going through Panasonic warranty and repair shops is not worth the wait.  Its tough these days living without a microwave with a large family.  We have definitely made some changes and can't wait to finally get our microwave back.  I mean I wish I would just go buy another one somewhere else...but then eventually I would have 2 microwaves which I do not need. When speaking with Panasonic I couldn't help but to think they knew there was a problem with their product before they put it on the market.  I can't believe this is the quality coming from a Japanese company.  Can't believe they wouldn't just send me a new one rather than have me go to a repair shop.  Needless to say...I will not be purchasing another Panasonic Microwave.,initially quit working month called warranty gave case number repaired repair shop week try going week wish wal mart returned gotten new going warranty repair shop worth wait tough living large family definitely change wait finally mean wish eventually need speaking help think knew problem market believe quality coming japanese company believe send new repair shop needle purchasing

The first two both lasted about 15 years each, which was well beyond expectations for either.  We bought this third unit based on the experience of the other two, plus it was a direct swap out in size for its built in cabinet. Would give it five stars in most areas, but with the power up to 1250 watts now, it has a tendency to over cook or burn stuff if not careful with the power and time settings. We are removing two stars because you must generally reduce the power setting by about 10% when cooking prepared frozen items per directions on packages (most based on 1100 watt units), or calculate a reduced cooking time to prevent overcooking and burned items.  The sensor cooking doesn't seem to be very sensitive, and popcorn will burn if using the auto sensor.  The older units had a push/pull latch, while the newer one uses a button release mechanism.

52930778,R1QDHLBGITZG60,B0009KMYHI,1.0,39.0,46.0,Y,Not holding up!,"Bought a Kenmore microwave in 2003 that served us well until the rotary motor stopped working. Saw good reviews on this one and it was just the right size so we ordered it from Amazon (Great price and super fast free delivery). So far, this thing has performed fabulously. It runs quietly (even the beeper isn't too loud), has great power and power distribution, and the door opener has, so far, operated smoothly and with ease (although we are holding our breath on this item in view of all the negative feedback we see on the door opener).    The only negative I have with this oven is the height of the cooking cavity. The advertised size of 1.6 cu. ft. is right but that size is mostly due to stretching the length and width and sacrificing height. The ceiling of the cavity is so low, we can barely get some of our larger drinking glasses inside. I am seriously doubting whether we would be able to get a large ham or turkey inside.    Only time will tell if this item continues to perform well. Foreign production, poor engineering and shoddy workmanship seems to be the order of today's manufacturing. I just wish we could get better response from our manufacturing base to get making things back into the good old USA with US labor which we need so desperately.    Update 2/21/2011:  Well, this appliance has let us down. It has been steadily going down hill since we started using it and my wife finally asked me to send it back; sadly, 1 day after the 30 day return period expired. It seemed to take longer to reheat and warm things and pop popcorn the first week we used it, and now it is definitely running out of power. It now takes at least 3 times longer to pop popcorn than when it was new and NEVER pops without leaving a large amount of unpopped kernels (it doesn't even have the power to burn the popcorn, no matter how long you let it run).

I couldn't stand this so, I took this thing out of the garage, where I had stored it for emergencies, and plugged it in. Sure enough, every time I turned it on at any setting, the DirecTV lost picture and gave a reception warning. This was a good 15-20 feet from the TV. This thing may have a dangerous microwave leakage problem and I am reporting this to the proper authorities. I have also decided to junk the thing to get it out of my life.",2011-01-26,561,"Bought a Kenmore microwave in 2003 that served us well until the rotary motor stopped working. Saw good reviews on this one and it was just the right size so we ordered it from Amazon (Great price and super fast free delivery). So far, this thing has performed fabulously. It runs quietly (even the beeper isn't too loud), has great power and power distribution, and the door opener has, so far, operated smoothly and with ease (although we are holding our breath on this item in view of all the negative feedback we see on the door opener).    The only negative I have with this oven is the height of the cooking cavity. The advertised size of 1.6 cu. ft. is right but that size is mostly due to stretching the length and width and sacrificing height. The ceiling of the cavity is so low, we can barely get some of our larger drinking glasses inside. I am seriously doubting whether we would be able to get a large ham or turkey inside.    Only time will tell if this item continues to perform well. Foreign production, poor engineering and shoddy workmanship seems to be the order of today's manufacturing. I just wish we could get better response from our manufacturing base to get making things back into the good old USA with US labor which we need so desperately.    Update 2/21/2011:  Well, this appliance has let us down. It has been steadily going down hill since we started using it and my wife finally asked me to send it back; sadly, 1 day after the 30 day return period expired. It seemed to take longer to reheat and warm things and pop popcorn the first week we used it, and now it is definitely running out of power. It now takes at least 3 times longer to pop popcorn than when it was new and NEVER pops without leaving a large amount of unpopped kernels (it doesn't even have the power to burn the popcorn, no matter how long you let it run).

UPDATE:  Died 3 years 2 months after purchase/Replacement died 3 years 4 months after purchasing,"SEE UPDATE BELOW:  We purchased this nice microwave about a month ago to replace our 20 year old microwave from my college years.  It never died, but was small and not very powerful.  This Panasonic is certainly not small.  It is huge.  Be sure to measure where you want it.  We'd redone our kitchen and had a microwave cabinet built.  We'd considered a built-in, but the cost differential is huge so we settled for the largest unit we could find to fit in the space.  This unit has many pros, and a few cons:  Pros:  Huge, if you have the space, you can cook whatever you want.  Powerful!!  The inverter technology is amazing, you really can defrost a frozen piece of meat without cooking it even a bit.  The push buttons are pretty intuitive.  The popcorn settings are perfect!  Cons:  It interferes with the WiFi when running at full strength.  The sensor cooking settings are not good enough to trust.  Of course I have read that this unit is prone to an early demise.  Lets hope that is not the case for us.  However, if you review all the microwaves you might consider buying, you will see that most are prone to breaking prematurely.  Given the low price, high power, and huge size, this is a good buy.  If it last 5 years, I will consider worth the price.  If it breaks sooner, I will try to update here.  And I will be dissapointed too!  UPDATE NOV 2013:  Just three years and two months after buying, it suddenly died died without warning.  When you went to cook, the light would turn on for a moment, and then off.  Dead.  The warranty on the electronics is only 1 year (doubled with my credit card), and while it is possible the magnetron died, which has a 5 year warranty, it is unlikely.  Not worth the hassle to drive an hour away to get it fixed, and maybe have to pay for it if it is just the electronics.  I've lowered my star rating to 3 stars.  I still loved the microwave, but it should last more than three years.  That said, it fits well where I want it almost like a built in,and it was FABULOUS while it worked.  So reluctantly, I am buying the same item as a replacement.  Call me crazy.  UPDATE 3/2017:  Our replacement microwave has started to fail.  IT works sometimes and sometimes you have to slam the door hard to make it work.  It is going to be totally dead shortly.

Lets hope that is not the case for us.  However, if you review all the microwaves you might consider buying, you will see that most are prone to breaking prematurely.  Given the low price, high power, and huge size, this is a good buy.  If it last 5 years, I will consider worth the price.  If it breaks sooner, I will try to update here.  And I will be dissapointed too!  UPDATE NOV 2013:  Just three years and two months after buying, it suddenly died died without warning.  When you went to cook, the light would turn on for a moment, and then off.  Dead.  The warranty on the electronics is only 1 year (doubled with my credit card), and while it is possible the magnetron died, which has a 5 year warranty, it is unlikely.  Not worth the hassle to drive an hour away to get it fixed, and maybe have to pay for it if it is just the electronics.  I've lowered my star rating to 3 stars.  I still loved the microwave, but it should last more than three years.  That said, it fits well where I want it almost like a built in,and it was FABULOUS while it worked.  So reluctantly, I am buying the same item as a replacement.  Call me crazy.  UPDATE 3/2017:  Our replacement microwave has started to fail.  IT works sometimes and sometimes you have to slam the door hard to make it work.  It is going to be totally dead shortly.  Based on two microwaves from the same model dying I would stay away!",update purchased month ago replace college died small powerful certainly small huge sure measure want redone kitchen cabinet built considered built cost differential huge settled largest fit space pro pro huge space cook want powerful inverter technology amazing defrost frozen piece meat cooking bit push button pretty intuitive popcorn setting perfect interferes wifi running strength sensor cooking setting trust course read prone early demise let case consider buying prone breaking prematurely given low price high power huge size consider worth price break sooner try update dissapointed update nov 2013 month buying suddenly died died warning went cook light turn moment off dead warranty electronics doubled credit card possible magnetron died warranty unlikely worth hassle drive hour away fixed maybe pay electronics i lowered star rating star loved said fit want built fabulous worked reluctantly buying item replacement crazy update 2017 replacement started fail slam door hard make going totally dead shortly based model dying stay away

After a few months, another scorch mark appeared, and one day I came home to my wife's report that it had given one last grand flash and died.     After this experience, I was interested in switching to a different model, but after two years, I still don't find any other large countertop microwaves which are as favorably-reviewed as this one. Looking for an alternative review service, I checked consumersearch.com, which recommended the \\""GE Profile JES2251SJ\\"" as the best large countertop microwave (non-convection), but Amazon customers give it such poor reviews (2 stars, 19 reviews) that I am hesitant to give it a try.

The power level button is especially quick and easy to use.  The biggest selling point was the inverter feature whereby the oven cooks constantly at the power level desired, not by cooking that alternates full power with no power at all.

I love the fact that when I set a lower power setting, the oven really cooks at that setting instead of the usual oven way of going full blast and then cutting off the cooking for a time.    I had a few surprises. The oven is a bit deeper than expected, taking more counter space than I would have liked, but the stated dimensions are accurate...I just did not pay close attention. The oven has a slight rock from the back. If I push on the back it rocks slightly. No big deal unless for some reason you push on the back of it. I never do. Just noticed it in setup and found no way to adjust the footpad height on any of the feet. Finally, I haven't found a way to turn off the timer reminder without opening and closing the door.

That and countless coffees, teas, burned popcorn! etc.  What we first noticed is it brought a cold cup of water to a boil in under two minutes!  The other 1200 watt microwaves need three or more.Upsides.  Quick and easy use.  Easy to understand buttons with a 1 minute or add a minute feature.  Going with white saved about 20$ off the black unit.  Thankfully the popcorn option works beautifully. No more stinky burned popcorn!Downsides.  Needs a better light.  It's hard to see your food in this oven.  Can be confusing options for setting the controls and clock.  Don't loose the manual!  The door button seems to stick but returns to normal when you close the door.  The bulb is not replaceable from the inside.The turntable can pop off the spinner, but that's not uncommon for these types.Cleaning is easy.

I looked for a Sharp, but they're hard to find in stores around here, so I began looking at other brands. I was impressed by the reviews of this Panasonic model on Amazon and other sites, and Amazon's price was right, not to mention free shipping!    The first oven we received was damaged in transit--the box was partly opened and the front of the oven was scratched. Gotta hand it to Amazon, one short trip to the site, and I had a return label and another oven on the way!

I really like the oven. It does seem a bit louder when cooking than our Sharp, but not so much that it's a problem. (Our kitchen isn't exactly the Fortress of Solitude around mealtimes anyway.)     I would prefer a few more one-touch selections, like beverage reheat. There are one-touch buttons for popcorn, sensor reheat, and sensor defrost. You get additional selections by pushing these buttons more than once. For example, the popcorn button cycles through 3.75, 3.0, and 1.75 ounce bag selections.

The turntable is large and works great--no problem turning a heavy casserole dish while reheating. The oven seems huge inside but is not overly large outside.     The very best feature of this oven is that the reduced powerlevels--the cooking power actually reduces to the set level, and the microwave element stays on the whole time. Much better than our old oven--when you set a lower level on that, the microwave element would keep running at full power, but just shut off for several seconds periodically, often resulting in hot and overcooked areas.

Mainly, the door open button has now become a little bit finicky in that it now needs to be pressed distinctly in the center to open the door fully. This can slow me down a bit when I forget and I push on it less than carefully, but it's not really a major functional issue, just an irritation when I have to press it a second time to pop the door open completely. Secondly, I would like to improve the defrost function for chicken specifically, because there's been a couple times when my bf has popped chicken into it for defrosting and entered the approx. correct weight into the monitor and it comes out slightly cooked around the outside edges. This ruins the flavor and texture of the chicken somewhat. So lately we've taken to either not using it for defrosting chicken or simply underestimate the weight as a workaround, but I'd love for that to be improved. Otherwise it's a great machine, capable of actually softening without melting a stick of butter when you use it on the 3 bar power level setting for about a min and a half - amazing! Its sensor function is also decent for reheating foods, though I find that you usually want to take it out around the time when it beeps and starts giving you a timed countdown as it usually gets it a bit too hot otherwise.

13417430,R1IYYWSCHBK236,B0009KMYDM,3.0,7.0,8.0,Y,"Bad features, loud, feels cheap...but cheap for it's size...","My mother has this microwave and after a few uses I realized how glad it is not mine.  Small things about it that frustrated me, but a long list of small things...<br /><br />  (1)  Operation is LOUD for a brand new microwave...my moms 15 year old one wasn't that loud (nor is the brand new one in my home).<br />  (2)  Door feels horribly cheap like it's hinges would snap & break with the slightest amount of pressure<br />  (3)  Opening the microwave is a pain because the button is so HARD to push in.  The microwave itself is not very heavy for one this size, so you have to hold it in place and then push the open button (or it will slide all over your counter)...this was the most frustrating thing for me<br />  (4)  Shutting the door is a task, you can't just gently push it and expect it to shut...you have to put some mmmpphhh into it and push it shut...and then when you do, it is horribly LOUD<br />  (5)  Most microwaves with an \\""Add Minute\\"", \\""Add 30 Seconds\\"", \\""Quick Minute\\"", \\""Quick 30 Seconds\\"", etc button only make you push that button to add the minute or 30 seconds before it starts...not this one!  It makes you push the \\""Quick Minute\\"" button and then the start button before it starts.  Whats the point of a \\""quick\\"" button if you have to push multiple buttons?  A silly complaint, but an important one to me<br />  (6)  WHO designed this thing??  The pictures don't show what the front of it really looks like in person, but they should because it is plain ugly.  All microwaves have those gray-like waves in the door window so you can't totally see inside, but this one has brighter blue-like colored waves and they are huge!  So huge that you can hardly see inside when the microwave is running.  It is just tacky looking and takes away from a huge feature that most people NEED in a microwave (to be able to see inside when things are being cooked!!)<br />  (7)  My 1 year old weighs more than this microwave...and if you have ever picked up a microwave, you know this can't be a good thing.  It just doesn't feel like it has any quality built into it.  Yes, it is easy to move around if you needed to, but why would you want to??  I want a microwave that stays put on my counter when I'm using it and this doesn't.  The only thing that feels solidly constructed is the glass turntable (which by the way is huge!)<br />  (8)  So...this is supposed to be 1250 watts, huh??  I don't think it performs like a 1250 watt oven by any means.  My mothers 15 year old 1000 watt and the 1000 watt one in my home both out cook this thing by a long shot.  Something that takes 25 seconds to heat in my microwave takes about 45 seconds in this one, I then have to mix it and reheat for another 20 seconds or so.<br /><br />So, in short...I wouldn't buy this microwave.

Small things about it that frustrated me, but a long list of small things...  (1)  Operation is LOUD for a brand new microwave...my moms 15 year old one wasn't that loud (nor is the brand new one in my home).  (2)  Door feels horribly cheap like it's hinges would snap & break with the slightest amount of pressure  (3)  Opening the microwave is a pain because the button is so HARD to push in.  The microwave itself is not very heavy for one this size, so you have to hold it in place and then push the open button (or it will slide all over your counter)...this was the most frustrating thing for me  (4)  Shutting the door is a task, you can't just gently push it and expect it to shut...you have to put some mmmpphhh into it and push it shut...and then when you do, it is horribly LOUD  (5)  Most microwaves with an \\""Add Minute\\"", \\""Add 30 Seconds\\"", \\""Quick Minute\\"", \\""Quick 30 Seconds\\"", etc button only make you push that button to add the minute or 30 seconds before it starts...not this one!  It makes you push the \\""Quick Minute\\"" button and then the start button before it starts.  Whats the point of a \\""quick\\"" button if you have to push multiple buttons?  A silly complaint, but an important one to me  (6)  WHO designed this thing??  The pictures don't show what the front of it really looks like in person, but they should because it is plain ugly.  All microwaves have those gray-like waves in the door window so you can't totally see inside, but this one has brighter blue-like colored waves and they are huge!  So huge that you can hardly see inside when the microwave is running.  It is just tacky looking and takes away from a huge feature that most people NEED in a microwave (to be able to see inside when things are being cooked!!)  (7)  My 1 year old weighs more than this microwave...and if you have ever picked up a microwave, you know this can't be a good thing.  It just doesn't feel like it has any quality built into it.  Yes, it is easy to move around if you needed to, but why would you want to??  I want a microwave that stays put on my counter when I'm using it and this doesn't.

35258448,R1VJRHADMV58PK,B0009KMYGY,5.0,74.0,76.0,Y,Panasonic NN-H765WF,"When my 25 year-old microwave died I started looking for a replacement.  After reading a number of reviews I settled on the Panasonic for several reasons.  One, I'm familiar with several Sharp ovens and a number of them have problems with their displays.  For example, my sister's Sharp has a problem with the numbers and when you enter, for example, a nine it will read 1 with the parts of the nine that make it a nine left off.  A 7 will also read as 1.  Her oven still works fine and times correctly for the numbers you punch in, but the readout problem means you have to pay attention to the numbers you enter.  Of the four Sharp ovens I've been around, all four suffer from that same fault.  Two, I wanted one big enough to use a 9x13 dish in and the Panasonic does.  While other ovens will also accommodate a 9x13 dish, they are larger ovens and take up more counter space.  This is the smallest oven that I found which can handle my 9x13 dishes and still rotate them on the turntable.  Some of the other ovens close to this size might handle 9x13 dishes provided the dishes don't have flanges on the ends to aid in lifting them as mine do.  Anyhow, it will accommodate the size dishes I wanted to be able to use.  Three, it has a sensor and I wanted to try one with it and see if it was an improvement.  Four, it happened to be on sale at the time.    After using it for three weeks I'm very happy with the oven.  It is much faster than the old one, which I expected, but it also cooks much more uniformly.  While I expected some improvement in uniformity, I received much more than I expected.  I am also very pleased with the sensor system.  As I mentioned earlier, I wanted to try a sensor oven, but did not realize that I would use it most of the time.  You want to nuke some potatoes, you do not have to figure out how much time per potato and multiply that by the number of potatoes.  Just poke your holes, punch sensor cook until it reads potatoes, and hit start.  I do find it does a better job if you turn your potatoes over after it beeps twice, but even if you don't it does an acceptable job.  The sensor reheat also works better than I expected and I find myself depending upon it rather than standing there and deciding I'll give the dish a couple of minutes and see it that's enough.  Lastly, the feature I like the best is the turbo defrost.  My old Kenmore required a lot of fiddling to do a good job of defrosting such as adjusting the output and making sure to turn the food over several times during defrost with several waiting periods mixed in.  While this oven still requires some fiddling, it requires far less and does a better job of defrosting without partially cooking.  On small portions all you need do is enter the weight and hit start, but with bigger portions it works best by turning over, and with large portions of items like ground beef you need to scrape off the defrosted meat part way through the process to avoid partial cooking.  Since most of the time the portions I'm defrosting fall into the smaller category I don't have to do anything more than enter the weight and allow the oven to do the rest.    On the con side, I don't like the way the turntable drive system engages the platter.  It works fine, but you have to peer in and align the dogs on the bottom of the platter with their respective recesses in the drive flange.  That is not earthshaking, but it is a miner aggravation.  I can think of several ways to design the system so it would be easier to install the platter so it engaged the drive dogs correctly.    So as it stands, provided the oven is as reliable as the other Panasonic products I've used I heartily recommend it and so far I see no reason to think it won't be.  I was also pleased with the service and price from Amazon, but I've come to expect that level of service and pricing from them.  I've only had one foul up with an Amazon order, and when they were notified of the problem they quickly corrected it, in fact much more quickly than I expected.

And shielding edges of a large salmon fillet kept them from cooking during the defrost - I had the whole fillet thawed excellently in less than 30 minutes despite my having forgotten to take it out of the freezer the night before.<br /><br />We also like the Quick Minute feature, which is just right for warming up a large mug of our combination green/rooibos/hibicus tea.<br /><br />I read a complaint in one review of the plastic surface scratching very easily. This may be because the person did not remove the plastic protective sheet that covers the pads during shipping. Because there are cut-outs for the buttons, this plastic sheet is not real obvious.

I pulled the cabinet off to investigate the problem (needed a torx security bit to do this) - if you attempt this, don't forget to unplug the microwave first.  I very cautiosly plugged the microwave back in (keeping my distance from the exposed electronics while wearing safety glasses), and started it... the inverter (p/n F606Y6G00CP) was smoking and melting part of it's plastic housing. I have opted to scrap the microwave versus trying to replace this $75+ part.      Before buying this microwave I would recommend googling \\""panasonic inverter problem\\"". As far as I can tell, these Panasonic ovens have a chronic quality problem.  The science behind the inverter results in a lighter microwave oven, meaning cheaper to produce and ship.  My recommendation is to avoid this oven even though the feature set seems compelling, and reviewers (mostly who just bought the oven) are giving it high ratings.    On the plus size, we loved the large size and the high wattage rating - foods cooked quicker in this microwave than our previous 1000 watt oven.  We used the sensor cooking for 3.5 oz popcorn bags, and it worked fairly well, leaving only 20 or so old maids in the bag (however my advice is to follow the directions on the popcorn bag instead of using the sensor cooking - keep track of how many seconds are really needed, then just key that in for future bags).  Also, the turbo defrost did a decent job in defrosting hamburger evenly and quickly.    This microwave did disrupt our Wi-Fi (802.11g) network.  We frequently stream video wirelessly and the microwave would disrupt the signal, pausing the streaming.  The scarey thing is my wife and I could stand together in front of the microwave, blocking the disruption (one of us alone apparently doesn't offer enough resistance to whatever signals the microwaveis emitting).    As much as I liked this microwave, I would not buy another Panasonic with inverter technology.

After 4 years, the magnetron tube died. The tube was under warranty, but Panasonic said they would charge $87 for labor. Guess what the game is? dissuade the customer from proceeding further because labor is not covered. I complained to the NJ Attorney General's office but the Panasonic head office would not budge.

You can enter time and press cook and it works.  It has a power button that reduces cooking power by reducing continuous cooking energy, not, as most do, by cycling on/off at full power.  This is good, but the button is stupid.  To set power 3, you have to push the power button 6 times.  It decrements from ten, one digit per press.  It also has a \\""quick minute\\"" button, which is good, but it, too, still requires that you press the \\""start\\"" button.  Not as quick as my old uWave, which just starts when you press the quick-buttons.  I also wish there was a \\""quick 30 sec\\"", which I used more than anything on the old oven.  There's also a \\""smart reheat\\"" button that's great.  It heats until it senses steam/heat given off the food.  But it's also stupid, since there's no control over the power level.  (Panasonic doesn't document this feature very well, really.)  There's a \\""Smart Cook\\"" button, that also cooks by sensing the steam/heat given off by the food.  It would be way cool if you could figure out the cooking profiles, but they don't document that, either--they just say \\""potato\\"" or \\""frozen pizza\\"" and assume they know how to cook it.  Again no power control, and no way to use it if you don't happen to be cooking potatoes or one of the other 8 food items listed.

Pros:  This is a large oven.  Anything that doesn't fit probably should not be cooked in a microwave anyway.  It is a powerful oven.  Things that took 90 seconds in our old oven only take 60 seconds in this one.  Function programming allows you to turn the clock on/off and the beeper on/off (see Cons).  Operating noise is very low.  Full-power cooking requires only setting cook time and pressing start.  The \\""Sensor Reheat\\"" function works well as long as your food is not covered (and anything with tomato products or beans probably should be covered).    Cons:  Our biggest complaint is the noise it creates when closing the door.  This produces a very loud, tinny clang that can be heard all through the house.    Although it is a large oven, it is lightweight and quite often pushing the door release will slide the entire oven backwards.    Changing the power level requires pressing the power level button multiple times - e.g., defrosting at 30% level requires pushing the power level eight times.  Our old oven required only two - power level and 3 on the keypad.    Likewise, setting nine minutes on the \\""Quick Min\\"" function requires pushing the \\""Quick Min\\"" button nine times and then pressing start.  Our old oven required only pushing \\""Quick Cook\\"" and 9 on the keypad (without having to press start).    The keypad had no tactile feel.  If you turn off the beep function, you need to pay close attention to the display to make sure the key you pressed actually activated.  Turning off the beep function also turns off the end-of-cycle beep.  Since the end-of-cycle beep is not nearly as loud and irritating as our old oven, we chose to leave this function \\""on.\\""    Conclusion:  Although not perfect, we are satisfied overall after using this unit for two months.

The defrost seems to be more even, but this is not a major change from my old GE.    Minuses:    The timer/done beeper is not loud enough. If I have the stove exhaust fan running on low, I cannot hear the beeper unless I am listening intently for it. If nothing is running in the kitchen, I can hear it at a much lower volume level than the old GE. The beeper does NOT repeat with reminders unless you turn the option on in the functions menu.     This microwave is electronically noisy. It kills my wireless WIFI connection whereas the old GE barely slowed it down. It also causes a noticable garbling of cordless phone calls. Again the GE did not do this. I don't know if the GE was abnormally good or if the Panasonic is abnormally bad, but the transition was downhill.

15797183,R3F8XOKAWSE2LQ,B0009KMYHI,5.0,589.0,599.0,Y,Very pleased with this oven,"After having my first microwave for about 18 years, it finally died and I did a lot of research before deciding to buy this Panasonic.   Having Amazon gift certificates, free shipping and a $25 kitchen and housewares discount influenced my decision and I have to say it was a great buy.  I'm very pleased with the evenness with which it cooks and defrosts.    I upgraded from a mid-size 650-watt oven to this full-size 1250-watt oven.  I have to remind myself sometimes that everything needs less time to cook.  However, there are a lot of pre-programmed features in this unit that make it easier.  For example, there is a sensor cook button that selects the time and power level for different kinds of foods depending on how many times you tap the button.  Types of food include baked potatoes, frozen pizza, frozen entrees, fresh vegetables, frozen vegetables and omelettes.  I made a baked potato last night that was cooked perfectly.  There is also a separate popcorn button (you can select from 3 different bag sizes) that also worked perfectly.  A More/Less button lets you add or subtract time to the sensor and popcorn settings.     There are a number of different functions you can select or turn on and off.  Some of the functions include language (English, French or Spanish), a choice of pounds or kilos, child lock, reminder beep (I turned that off because unlike my old oven which beeped every minute, this one beeps every 15 seconds which was annoying) and menu action which when turned on guides you through each step of cooking.  There is also a demo mode which is meant for retail displays but you can see how everything works without actually cooking anything.    Some other useful features are delayed start where you can use the timer to set the oven to start cooking at a later time and a keep warm setting if you won't be taking your food out of the oven immediately.  A Quick Min button lets you select 1-9 minutes simply by tapping the button the appropriate number of times.If you purchase this, I would suggest going through the owner's manual a couple of times.  I went through it once before I used the oven.  A couple of days later I went through it again and discovered that I had overlooked some shortcuts.    The only down side for me with this oven is losing some more counter space in a small kitchen.  Keep that in mind if you don't already have a full-size oven.    UPDATE:  It is now 2010 and I realized I have been using this oven for 3 1/2 years and I still love it!  I do a lot of actual cooking in it too, not just reheating, popcorn, etc.",2006-07-26,459,"After having my first microwave for about 18 years, it finally died and I did a lot of research before deciding to buy this Panasonic.

After literally 8 calls to Panasonic customer service (asking for the serial number, calling back with it, etc etc.) they agreed to at least cover the cost of a repair estimate (they eventually paid for the entire repair cost). <br /> <br />The problem was that the fuse had died. The authorized repair facilitiy told me that the only microwaves they ever get for repair are Panasonics; he said the problem is that to reduce their weight, they use smaller parts, like the tubes, which can't handle the load for long. He also said that their fuses don't last.  <br /> <br />The repair person recommended either Sharp or Sanyo as much longer lasting. I checked the weight of a similar-sized Sharp and saw that it weighed about 6 pounds more than the Panasonic--presumably because some parts are heftier. <br /> <br />When this newly-repaired Panasonic dies again, it will be long out of warranty and then we'll try our luck with a Sharp.

Nonetheless, I am very pleased with my purchase so far, including the speed with which I received it (within a week of ordering).  It is a big oven and does require more counter space but it is attractive-looking and the extra space is in the interior where you can cook almost anything of any size.  It is not heavy and I can move it easily if necessary; it has great features--the sensor heating, the various options which let the machine do the thinking or let you do it if you prefer.  It defrosts perfectly and cooks evenly; it is easy to use.  I have not tried the popcorn option yet but expect it to be excellent. Because it is a big oven, it would probably be best to have it on it's own electric circuit, especially if you are likely to be using other appliances at the same time.  I do not have a separate circuit and have had no problems so far, but I generally use it alone or with things like can openers that are not heavy  electric drains.
