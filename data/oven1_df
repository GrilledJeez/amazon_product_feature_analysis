A must have for small living spaces.,"My job requires extended hotel stays and this oven (in addition to an induction burner) has meant that I am able to keep my usual eating habits while living in a hotel room. I wasted no time testing this mighty little oven out- immediately after setting up the oven I roasted a 3lb rack of BBQ ribs to perfection. After cutting a pizza stone to fit the rack (you can also buy a specially sized Breville pizza stone accessory as well) I have baked several thin crust pizzas as well as baked pies, cookies, cakes and brownies. Of course it can also be used to toast.<br /><br />Surprisingly the baking times are a little bit longer than a conventional oven, even with the optional convection setting turned on. However, I have had no problem simply adding time and watching closely.<br /><br />If you are measuring for a spot do keep in mind that the metal exterior gets very hot. I try to only keep small ceramic/glass items on top if I have to set things there (it is perfect for keeping a glass/metal/ceramic dish warm. It is recommended that there should be 4in of open space on either side of the oven where vents are located.",2015-08-31

I almost did not get this size but I am glad I did because a half size foil pan (12&#34; x 10&#34; x 2.5&#34;) for the steamer tables fits very nicely in this oven and the contents do not burn, I very seldom use my full size range anymore.<br />When I was reading reviews before my purchase I came across several reviews describing measured temperature variations from what the oven was set at, I say ignore them!  I have baked a lot with this oven and have not encountered heat fluctuation problems nor have I needed to adjust times. If. You want to test this oven place slices of bread anywhere on the rack and toast! I guarantee you will be impressed with how even the toast is.<br />The only thing I baked that has not come out as expected at the cooking time stated in the recipe has been cookies on the supplied cookie sheet, the cookies burned slightly with the dark sheet supplied.<br />Some may find the fan a little on the noisy side.

WTF?,"There's much to like about this product.  I'll leave those aspectes to the other glowing reviews.  Let me make note of a design oversight that's endlessly annoying:  It's the pizza pan.  It's design is such that the middle is slightlly raised above the center which makes any oil used on the crust flow to the outside of the pan.  Secondly, the pan is so thin that it's impossible to pick it up with a hot mitt since the edge is on level with the rack.  To make use of the pan, I must take some utensil such as a butter knife to raise up the edge over the front of the rack so as to grab the pan.  Furthermore, the pan is so lightweight, it's dangerous to actually try and remove items from it - it will easliy slide across any surface.",2015-08-05

Amazon Prime did their usual superior thing with on-time delivery. A fairly large unit, it fit well on the counter and the island. Because of radiated heat risks, we decided on the countertop. The most important thing to do with this unit is to read the instructions and go through the pre-cooking sequence. It is a dry run of the controls, heating elements and displays. Since the energy draw is 1800 watts (15 amps), we were concerned about long it would take to reach the desired temperature. In a word - quickly. Less than 2 minutes for 450 deg. Be very careful not to run any other high draw items, like a coffee maker, on the same circuit at the same time. Always, always use oven mitts or tongs to take food out of the oven. Food seems to stay hot longer.<br /><br />We are still exploring the Smart Oven's capabilities, but what we have seen thus far has exceeded our expectations.

The front panel controls are REALLY slow to respond...you basically have to &#34;triple-click&#34; or even &#34;quadruple-click&#34; the Start button just to turn the thing on.  This appears to be by design--the first click doesn't do anything except &#34;wake up&#34; the toaster oven from its sleep mode, but the waking up process takes some time, during which the controls are inoperative.  Once the device has finally woken up, you have to press Start again to actually turn it on.<br /><br />Second (and this has been reported in many other reviews), the convection fan is LOUD.  So loud that it sounds broken.  Maybe it is.<br /><br />You can certainly argue that the fault is mine for letting the triple-click thing get on my nerves, but come on...it's 5:30am, I'm barely awake, and I really don't want to deal with my toaster oven giving me a hard time.",2015-07-30

The oven arrived today and my husband unpacked it. The packing is nicely done. He set the oven up on our counter and I began to read him the instructions regarding the &#34;one time&#34; start-up procedure.  Basically you take out the pans and the rack, set the oven on &#34;pizza&#34; mode and let it heat (at 450 degrees) for 15 minutes. At my instruction, he pushed the start button and the oven began to pre-heat.  So far, so good.  About 2 or 3 minutes into pre-heat, the oven beeped repeatedly and the display indicated &#34;E03&#34; in large characters.  I looked this code up under troubleshooting and found that it means the oven has exceeded the temperature for which it was designed.  The manual states that you are to unplug the oven and wait at least 15 minutes.  We did this and repeated the process, unfortunately with the same results.  My husband attempted to call Breville's customer service, which had closed about an hour before his attempt (they are on Pacific time).  To say that I am less than pleased with this oven is a HUGE understatement.  When you pay $250 for a convection oven, you expect it to work correctly right out of the box.  My family was really looking forward to some fresh baked cookies - but that will not happen tonight - at least not in this unit.  Depending upon how the discussion goes with Breville tomorrow, I may update this review.  For now, I advise you to choose another product. [PLEASE READ MY UPDATE BELOW.]<br /><br />UPDATE &#62; As noted in the instructions that came with the oven, I first contacted Breville to describe the problem. The young lady was helpful and advised that their return process would probably take around two weeks.  She advised me to return the defective unit to Amazon.  I've dealt with Amazon for quite a while so it was no surprise that they were GREAT to deal with in this case.  I notified them of the defective oven and they shipped me a new one immediately.  They also provided a UPS label (for free) to return the defective unit.<br />The new oven arrived in two days and I immediately unpacked it and this time was successful in navigating through the &#34;break-in&#34; process. Since my family wanted cookies with the first oven, that's what I tried first in this one. The cookies baked very well and my family was duly impressed. I've made several more batches of cookies since then.  I've also had bagels (yummy) and even one frozen pizza.  So far so good.  I'm very happy with this product and am looking forward to using it for many years to come.  I took away one star due to the incident with the first oven.  My husband noted on that oven there were two quality control stickers applied to the &#34;feet&#34;.  He wonders how that defective unit ever left the plant.

It gets used at least 3 times a week, and I love being able to bake even in the summertime.  As a result of how economical it is to use, we've begun broiling our broccoli  (YUM!) and other veggies that we'd normally just steam.  I haven't had a day's problem with this oven and I've never regretted buying it.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Full disclosure - I did not buy my new Breville BOV800XL Smart Oven on Amazon, but rather on a popular auction site where the seller, a national chain, posted a buy-here-pick-up-in-store listing for the same model at the same price. I wanted to begin working with the new oven as quickly as possible, so I opted that option.<br /><br />I brought the unit home, unboxed it (which was easy, though the whole appliance was extremely well packed) and made a space for it on the counter top. Reading the instruction booklet, I learned there is a 'break in bake&#34; cycle that must be performed before you actually begin baking up a storm.  After this was finished, I turned my attention to various &#34;Paleo&#34; recipes that have captured our attention.<br /><br />Since then I've made casseroles, gluten-free focaccia bread and other lovely delectables, and there's just one thing I can say - WOW!  For the casserole, I used the convection feature and it baked up so nicely.  We had half of the same casserole 2 days later and reheating in the Breville was so easy.  Toasting gluten-free muffins and breads is easy as can be and I am amazed at how little the house heats up when using this oven.  It's really interesting, because the silly thing does put off a substantial amount of heat all around it, yet for some reason the rest of the house isn't warming up as a result.  If somebody can explain this to me, I'd love to know how that works.<br /><br />Another thing I've noticed is how quickly the oven cools down after use. In my first baking experience, the oven took just under 5 minutes to warm up to 450 degrees, I baked using the convection feature for 30 minutes, and within 10 minutes of turning it off, the oven was cool enough to handle without potholders or mitts. So, from start to finish, the oven was on for 35 minutes total and was cool  less than 45 minutes after I began. Amazing!<br /><br />Time will tell how well the Breville holds up, but at this point I couldn't be happier with it. I'm looking forward seeing if there is any difference in the electricity bill next month - I've completely quit using the full-sized oven, so we'll see. It's entirely possible the electric bill will reflect no change, but the amount of production out of the kitchen will have exceeded all prior benchmarks.  :-)tes to warm up to 450 degrees, I baked using the convection feature for 30 minutes, and within 10 minutes of turning it off, the oven was cool enough to handle without potholders or mitts.

Breville insisted it was my house wiring (it's a new house). Their unit runs dirty, feedbacks spikes into your house wiring that could damage computers and other electronics. Amazon was GREAT! Took the thing back, sent me a Cuisinart oven-steamer, same 1800 wattage, and guess what, no light flickering. Breville is ignoring a serious problem with their oven.<br />Update: The unit (the second one) now causes a severe flickering in all lights in the house. Read the reviews-this common with these ovens.<br />The first one had a flaw with the door jamming against the middle rack. This rack is pulled out via magnets when you open the door, a nice touch if it worked. To Brevilles credit, they picked it up and sent me a new one. The second unit seemed to work better for a week or so, then began to jam also though not as often. my verdict at this point is: It is a cleverly designed oven that falls short on quality.

It.,"We are outfitting a summer home and one of the things I really missed was my toaster oven. I have a very nice Cuisinart convection oven at home that has been reliable and does the job. I probably use a toaster oven several times a day for baking bread, making toast, reheating leftovers, baking casseroles, all the things I don't want to heat up in a full size oven. Compact. An energy saver.<br /><br />The model I use at home isn't available anymore, so I researched and selected Breville. They make very good appliances. And this is no exception. Quality build. Intuitive operation. Thoughtful presets that can easily be manually adjusted. A pre-heat feature with an alert. Easy to clean. A TIMER! My goodness how I love the timer. A real score.<br /><br />UPDATE November 2015: Since returning home I learned that (at least) two households in our large family have the very same Breville toaster oven, and each home's cook swears by it. One in-law loves his so much that when there is an occasion to offer a gift to clients and service providers, he gifts this toaster oven. It's that good.<br /><br />Will report back if there are any problems, but I don't expect any.<br /><br />UPDATE December 2016: The thermostat in the toaster oven in our main residence finally died after (I don't know), ten or eleven years. We placed it with the Breville 800XL and continue the love. If we had the extra room I might have opted for the newer Breville Smart Air model which is more versatile (multiple racks, dehydrating capability, can hold a 5-qt Dutch oven ...), but we didn't have that option.<br /><br />The baked eggs we prepared this morning were absolutely perfect.

Later the display began fading and even dropping symbols.  Now when cooking it almost completely blanks out.  Their website instructs you to unplug it and listen for a beep when you plug it in, which indicates all is good.

Since I cook for one most of the time, I knew its size was perfect. What I did not expect was that the oven would also be large enough to handle a roast duck with ease. It is easy to use, although it is rather complex for a toaster oven. I've never had a bad result using this. I also learned how poorly insulated my actual oven is, and the relative advantage in cooking in having a smaller oven. Be advised: even without convection turned on, cooking times are dramatically lessened. Also, I've never managed to burn anything in this oven, because there are no hot spots and the thermostat is quite reliable. I have baked numerous pizzas using my old 13&#34; pizza stone, and the aforementioned duck. I regularly bake french bread and bread puddings, and pies as well.

I thought that was a novel idea and couldn't really believe you could do that. I asked to use his oven to bake some cornbread and he told me to use the toaster over. I had my doubts, especially as I am gluten free and gluten free baking usually takes longer than normal. I was amazed and surprised that it turned out so well, so once we got back home, I did a lot of research and bought this Breville toaster oven. Have not been disappointed. It works great for everything from broiling hamburgers to baking, reheating leftovers from the restaurant you dont want to come out soggy, and of course, making toast!! What I like the best is that it does not heat up the entire room like putting on the oven does, something I dont like during the warm summer months. The temperatures and times are pretty much exact as you would expect for a regular oven. It does have convection and I have read that convection can make baking times shorter, but I have not seen that to be the case. Perhaps it is becuz I bake gluten free and it takes generally longer.

Over the years we've owned many toaster ovens (Black & Decker (3), GE, DeLongi (2) and none of them really worked very well. Toast from all of them was always dark on one side light on the other. The Brevelle, by contrast, makes perfect toast, provided you get the setting right. It also has a bagel setting that toasts the split half of the bagel and warms the other side--great for hamburger or hot dog buns. The bake function with convection works beautifully--great for baking potatoes.  We're still in the first 4 months of ownership but unless durability becomes an issue this toaster oven is a winner.

Even for the price, it performs as well or better than advertised.  The pre-heat is 5 minutes, and using a digital oven thermometer to test, it's much more accurate than my full size oven.  The controls are intuitive and easy to use, and certain safety features (it has a two hour auto-shutoff, for instance) give me peace of mind with my teenager, who can be forgetful from time to time.  From toast, to bagels, to baking, it's simply excellent.  It's important to read the included instructions on operating it, simply to get the results you want.  Cleaning is simple and easy, and at a size similar to mid-sized microwaves, it takes up very little space.  In fact, with a little adjustment of counter space, I put it where my old standard 4-slice toaster sat.  I didn't have any &#34;markings&#34; on the case that others have mentioned.  It's also light enough to carry that if we have a family gathering, I can take with, so if I have something I want to bake onsite, it's completely possible even when other ovens are full.  The beeper is no more annoying than any of my other cookers (microwave, oven timer).  As for not having a light, it would be just a bulb to replace if it had one.  I'm fine using the flashlight feature of my smartphone.  This is not a toaster oven.  This is a kitchen workhorse.  Simply put, my wife and I could not be happier with it!",2015-06-07

It's an excellent bagel toaster but not good for much else. It is solid but there are a few design flaws that make it useless and in some cases dangerous. It's supposed to be an oven but it functions only as a toaster.<br />1. The interior is very small. It replaced another that was a little larger on the exterior but regular cookware could fit inside. I have to purchase additional cookware to use this oven.<br />2. The lock that's on the top two levels means that the shelf must be tilted to remove the shelf. If you need to remove a pan from the oven it must be removed before the shelf can be removed. Because the interior is so small a hand can't be placed into the hot oven to grasp the hot cookware.<br />***Tilting the shelf up , as one must do, to remove the cookware spills the hot food into the oven.***<br />3. DANGER: The shelf is not the correct size or the walls are not sufficiently strong. I had one pound of hotdogs on the top shelf and the shelf slipped out of its support and spilled them into the bottom of the oven. They did send an extra shelf because we were not sure that the one provided was the correct size. The shelf needs to be about 1/8 inch wider to better grab the slots for the shelf. The shelf lock that Cooks Illustrated like but which causes the problems can't be removed since they are welded into place.<br />4.

The handle and the controls do not get hot.  If this makes sense, it isn't radiating a lot of heat into the room or to objects around it, but the oven itself will be painful to touch.

My previous toaster would start cooking my food immediately and would not need 5 minutes to pre heat to reach the temperature desired.  My expectations is that a toaster oven would be quick to heat food, and this definitely does not.  This item acts like a big oven.  I would have saved money and just put my waffles/pizza food in the big oven and got the same results.  I tried using the toast settings and the food just does not seem properly cooked using the toast option.  It's like the toast setting is surface heating and not cooking.  I just can't find a setting that gets hot right away and really can be used to cook Eggo's or Van's Waffles or frozen pizza properly/well.  To me, this is unforgivable for a toaster oven, especially in the morning where we are fighting for time.<br /><br />The knobs seem to stick and seem cheap to me.<br /><br />Lastly, when i do use this as a bake setting, I set the desired temp and hit start.  It pre heats and when it reaches that temp 5 or more minutes later like a big oven, the smart oven starts the timer immediately.  This works if you wait right at the breville and wait for the temp to be reached.  If you are waiting for the beep, you are usually away from the smart oven.  It should let the user hit a button to indicate that the  food is in the oven and now cooking rather than assume you were right there when the magic temp was reached.  You don't get to see the temp buildup, so good luck guessing when to be around the oven.<br /><br />this is a bad product and not worth the money.

Purchased in 2010.  It was great at the beginning,  It would make perfect toast at a #2 setting.  8 months later I started noticing that it was loosing power. In 2011 I was making the same perfect toast on a #3 setting.  Fastforward to 2014 and on a good day I have to use the #5 setting to make toast,  sometimes it is #7, the toast is no longer perfect,  I have to turn it if I want it toasted on both sides.  The heating element on the top works when it wants to and the heat output is much lower.  If I want to bake, I have to watch whatever it is I am baking and make cooking time adjustments.  The air convection feature started failing on year 3, and died on year 4.<br />I buy the best my budget allows, and I take good care of things.  I would expect this kind of performance from a $50.00 toaster oven, not from one that costs $250.00",2015-05-08

My previous one was cheap and man did I pay the price with it.  The timer dial was mechanical clicking type.  And, it would never tick down to zero and would burn my food if I didn't sit there and watch it.  Needless to say, the Breville has an electronic timer that functions like that of a microwave.  And it never has the above mentioned problem.  It does preheat before starting the timer, so take that into consideration when you are programing the time to cook.  The magnets that pull out the baking rack are a great idea that means you may not even need to use oven mitts to get to your food.

Nice and big - lots of room to fit a full 9x9 inch baking pan. I love that it also automatically turns off. No complaints and I'm telling all my friends they should get one. The middle rack will come out when you open it so you can grab toast off the rack without burning yourself. The top and sides definitely get warm/hot so don't put anything on it or around it that could melt or be hazardous. You can also warm plates on the top if you wanted to. I like to soften my butter up by laying it on top if needed.  Also comes with a baking pan, pizza pan, and broiling pan. Wish I had this years ago. The digital display works great, there are lots of settings to work with, and I could ask for nothing more from my new special addition to my kitchen. I'd highly recommend reading the whole manual when you get it. It isn't that hard and well worth it to learn how to care for it.

We've had various &#34;toaster ovens&#34; over the years, all falling apart at various stages with full time use.  I'm embarrassed to say that I actually bought this oven because of the cutting board that neatly fits over the top of it instead of having a cutting board on the counter top all of the time.  The cutting board is a super nice feature, but it also allows for having other items on top of the oven that don't get hot.  I keep our food scale on top of it because I often use it when prepping food and it stows away nicely without fuss or mess.<br />Having said that, we are so impressed with this oven I can't say enough about it.  It is spacious inside so we actually use it often for cooking rather than heating up the oven.  Cookies convect perfectly.  Frozen pizza comes out with crisp crust and nicely melted cheese that isn't overcooked.  Leftovers are warmed all the way through without the microwave.  A hot plate can be kept warm for someone coming home late for dinner.  A full dinner can be cooked in it.  I use it a lot for cooking chicken breast for an evening meal.  It's also nice for holidays when you need took cook multiple dishes on different temperatures at the same time; it's an extra oven.<br />The first day we got it I told my son to use the toast settings because it toasts the outside of the bread, and not the inside.  He scoffed at me and wondered why it would  make any difference... but it does.  He was surprised too, there is something so yummy about toast that is crisp on the outside, yet soft and fluffy on the inside.

I have not used it but got a bad impression just taking it out of the box. I will review it later on based on how it functions. My usual test in quality is checking out the controls. I paid high prices for two other Breville appliances and was greatly impressed by the smart grille and the juice fountain duo. The two knobs on the grille are the highest quality and I consider commercial grade. Here with the smart oven, the knobs are cheap and flimsy and typical of cheap Chinese manufacture that is not of quality. This oven is Breville priced on the high side but in this case not Breville standards when it comes to manufacturing. Even though the other appliances are also Chinese manufacture they are better made. I do not have good vibes on the quality of the oven. The cheap knobs feel like the oven controls will fail. I will find out soon and update. If I saw this in a store and checked it out physically first, I would not buy it because of the cheesy knobs alone.<br />Update: I find the appliance functions as a decent oven however the first impression of flimsy controls was dead on accurate. These are the worst I have seen in awhile and definitely do not belong on a high priced appliance. I detracted one star to two stars for poor quality of the controls. This will definitely not be a long lasting appliance with shoddy cheap construction. This appliances controls are in sharp contrast to other Breville appliances. I do not recommend this oven due to cheap quality and high price. Strange as it may seem the quality of the knobs and controls are a direct indicator of durability without maintenance. I found this to be a reliable way to grade a appliance or electronic device over the years. It is a strong indicator of how much a manufacturer places on the quality of their product. Nothing good here.<br /><br />Update<br />After using the oven several times I do like the way the controls operate the oven but not the quality of them physically. First you use one dial to decide what operation to perform then set a temperature and then the timer dial for how long you wish it to run.<br />After about the fifth time I used the oven the convection fan started to make a bad noise on the startup. It does not appear to be of any physical quality to speak of as I stated earlier. I stand by my initial impression and rating.

So what if It makes toast (perfectly) or bakes cookies (perfectly), or reheats calzones (perfectly).

It is like a Zen moment when you gaze upon perfectly browned toast each and every time you put bread in the toaster.  The left over and reheated calzone is just as crisp and piping hot as when first placed before you in the restaurant.  It is a true joy driving to work knowing I will not come home to a charred and smoldering house simply because I forgot to turn off the toaster (it turns itself off).  It is also fun when my guest notice the stylish and amazingly simple appliance sitting on the counter.  They can not help but laugh at me when I tell them it is a $250 toaster oven.  But then I get to show them how it toast bread and they just stare in a Zen like trance as the toast emerges in its perfectly brown glory.

Repeated the above process and received the 3rd oven in 4 days this time. So far, #3 is working fine after 2 weeks. However, I have no confidence in the longevity of this oven at this point. Our previous toaster oven (made by Krups) lasted 11 years; I'd be surprised if we get 2 years out of this one.<br /><br />By the way, since the same FedEx driver delivered all 3 ovens in a relatively short period of time, he asks me how my expensive oven is doing whenever he delivers other packages.

There's a convenient guide on the oven door instructing you which position to put the rack in.  Also, it includes a baking pan, a roasting insert that going into the baking pan (to catch grease and drippings from cooking meats and such) as well as a pizza pan.<br /><br />I would recommend adjusting temperatures as their default settings may not be consistent with, say, frozen foods purchased at the supermarket.<br /><br />I also like that the oven preheats very quickly and seems to generate less heat on the outside than toaster ovens I've had in the past.

After owning a series of less-expensive ovens, including well-known brands, which failed to work properly and often fell apart, the Breville is a welcome relief.  Toast is done consistently for a given setting, whether the oven is cold or hot.  The baking thermometer is accurate, and the convection setting works as intended.  The presets are consistent but require some getting used to; for instance, using the &#34;frozen&#34; setting for a given item.  We also like the pizza capabilities, be sure to get the perforated crisping pizza pan (and the stone if you cook fresh pizza).<br /><br />All in all, five stars and a good investment.<br /><br />EDIT Update May 2016:  This oven continues to work flawlessly, is used many times daily instead of the range with not a single issue or malfunction.

Nice aluminum. After setting up and doing the 15 minute burn in I used the oven twice for some hamburgers and toasted buns. After the buns had finished I noticed that the LCD looks weird. It had already begun to mess up. It was displaying random stuff with the turn of the dials. After a 15 minutes unplugged the display has returned to normal (I have not tried to recreate the issue).  The dials feel cheap and flimsy. Sometimes when making selections the screen will move two choices rather then one at a time. So the dials are not calibrated very well.  The oven operates very well. I have seen reviews about the temperature being off. I have not yet noticed this.  This oven has been out for some time now. I would have thought the company to fix these issues a little more proactively.  So, my first impressions are not that high for a machine that cost this much. Price to quality of the product should be higher. 3 of 5 stars. It works well when you don't have to mess with glitchy LCD screens and over sensitive dials.  UPDATE:  After some more time with the oven I decided to get a thermometer and make sure I was getting the right temperature to see if the other reviews had some truth. To my surprise there is. I have been frequently using the oven to bake between 400-450 degrees Fahrenheit. The thermometer I just purchased reads roughly 100 or more degree cooler than what the ovens display says it should be at when the preheat is completed. With this being said I am going to have to reduce my 3 star rating down to a 2 star rating.   Uploaded two photos.",2015-03-17

The Wolfe died -which was OK because no microwave combo made does a decent job of either microwaving or playing the role of oven.<br /><br />We weren't really expecting much from the Breville. However, we needed something to take care of the small jobs that weren't worth firing up a big Wolfe gas oven.<br /><br />My wife seriously doubted whether a small appliance could bake -which she loves to do and is very fussy about. The &#34;convection&#34; part kept her doubting despite being assured that the oven could bake in normal mode. She immediately tested it with cookies, muffins and custard. All of which cooked perfectly. Her real test, however, was to bake a full-size cake. It came out as well as any cake cooked in the gas oven. It surprised both of us.<br /><br />Pizzas are great and evenly cooked. Meat roasts very well in convection mode. Frozen dinners that don't do well in microwaves (like where the instructions recommend conventional cooking) come out cooked as well as any frozen dinner can cook.<br /><br />We've been using it for three months and honestly cannot come up with a downside.",2015-03-15

I called the company and complained and the representative grudgingly areed to replace the tray.  From then on I kept the tray covered in aluminum foil.  After that I used the oven all the time and loved it.  Until 2 months after the warranty period that is.  That's when the convection fan died.  I've tried to call the company but all they do is keep me on hold telling me how much they value my call.  Of course since it conveniently died after the 1 year warranty period, I seriously doubt that they would do anything anyway.  This was a very expensive oven and to have it last 1 year and 2 months is really pathetic.  My previous DeLongi lasted 10 years. There are many less expensive ovens on the market and I intend to find one.  Don't waste your money.<br /><br />March 23, 2015.  I find that I must edit my review.  Since I was unable to reach Breville by phone, I sent an angry email to them saying that I did not expect an expensive item that was so highly rated to fail 14 months later.  Twenty-four hours after I sent that email I received a response and a return shipping label.  I packed up the oven and shipped it back on March 17th.  Today, the 23rd of March, I received a brand new replacement!  One of the reasons I was so upset (aside from the cost of the item) was that I used this smart oven more than my stove.  I really missed not having it and I am absolutely delighted to have it back and working well.  I have apologized to the company representative for assuming they wouldn't stand by their product and I was obviously wrong.  I've changed my review to 5 stars and would highly recommend Breville's product and their customer service!",2015-03-13

I was initially looking for an oven that I could bake pies in during the summer heat without heating up my whole kitchen.Not only does this work flawlessly for full size pies, everything I roast,bake,broil and toast comes out great. I've actually baked a thin flatbread pizza right on the middle rack ( no pan) and it was incredibly crisp and bubbly in about 5 minutes! The oven shines at bread and cookies too.<br />It takes up a big space on the counter but it replaces my toaster oven that never worked well. The breville cleans up nicely, all the stainless, buttons and glass look new after 2 years. My only complaint is that you have to pay attention to pushing the buttons just so--a few times I thought I had started the oven and it never turned on, but since I've become aware of that &#34;flaw&#34;, it's never happened again.

The issue is that the exterior of the oven gets extremely hot when in use and can potentially cause burns.  For over $250 the oven should have been insulated better so that the exterior would not get so hot.  I spoke with Breville and they acknowledged that the heat generated by the oven is so great it can melt the power cord if the cord stays in close proximity to the oven.  The company recommends at least 4 inches of space on each side of the oven due to the heat it generates.  It seems counterintuitive for a small convection oven to require so much space in order to safely operate.  In my view, more should have been done to keep the exterior of the oven cool in order to reduce the risk of harm by users.",2015-02-20

Is that where you're supposed to store old pans?&#34; I smile because they live in a golden age of efficient cookery.<br /><br />The Breville Smart Oven is a revelation. It easily handles all tasks. Convenient presets allow my kids to make toast, the wife and I to pop in a frozen pizza after a little too much wine, and the babysitter to heat up leftovers. The unit isn't limited to presets, however. We've roasted chickens, baked cookies and broiled steaks with great results. The included baking sheets are decent, but Williams-Sonoma Goldtouch baking sheets bump this thing up a notch. Cleanup is relatively easy thanks to a removable crumb tray and brushed metal interior.<br /><br />Basically, this thing has made our lives easier. What more could a person want from a small appliance?",2015-01-31

I am an accomplished cook and bread maker.  This oven turns out the best homemade bread, cookies and pizza. Nice Crust on the bread and  pizza that is perfect.  It has the easiest controls for those of us who like easy.  During the holidays I put it to the test.  Everything but the turkey was baked in this great oven. Never owned a convection oven? Well let me say it is the best.  It is right up there with my 15 year old Cuisinart Food Processor and 12 year old Kitchen Aid Mixer. My brother who is also an accomplished baker, ordered one after seeing how great mine was. Yes, it cost more but trust me it is worth every penny.

Heats evenly and quickly,"For over a year we have had this oven, and it's been a great addition! Heats evenly and quickly and has so far cooked everything I've put in it as well as the larger oven in the stove. This could easily substitute for a range oven if you don't need to roast or bake big things.<br /><br />I wish I could award 1/2 star less because the roasting pan that comes with it is OK and not the worst quality, but somewhat thin material and not as easy to clean as my other pans. Unfortunately I haven't found substitutes that take full advantage of the roominess of the oven, or this wouldn't detract.<br /><br />Originally I bought this as an extra to use for holidays and guests, but my husband loves so much he uses it whenever he has to roast anything, especially to roast large chickens once a week.<br /><br />Updated July 2015: we like it so well we bought another for our summer camp - so much more reliable than a 50 year old range oven!

I've used it a few times and it's done the job.  I did some tests on what the temps are throughout the process and noticed it wasn't up to temp when pre-heat sounds.  I got this back from Breville, I've never seen it in a review though.<br /><br />========================================================================================================<br />Thank you for contacting Breville USA Support. Using a thermometer is not an accurate way to measure temperature on this product. The ‘preheat’ signal sounds at 75% of the target temperature. This provides the fastest, combined preheating and cooking time.<br /><br />This is because when the ‘preheating’ alert sounds, signaling the user to open the oven door and insert food, there is dramatic temperature loss inside the oven. If the alert sounded at 100% of the target temperature, opening the door would mean a lot of this waiting time is &#34;wasted&#34;.<br /><br />We have calculated that by sounding the preheat at 75% of the target temperature, with the door being opened to place food inside the oven, that we recover to the target temperature up to 2 minutes faster. This is why the temperature on the LCD screen does not match the target temperature at the ‘preheat’ signal.<br /><br />To ensure best results simply follow the same times and temperatures you would in a traditional home oven adjusting only if necessary.<br />========================================================================================================<br /><br />In general I've had to add 5 or so minutes and the last time I added 10deg too and it came out great.",2015-01-28

Our previous toaster oven was stylish and mid-range, but so hated for all the usual burning reasons: mainly ourselves taking food in and out, and the food itself, with uneven and unpredictable toasting and inadequate presets and timer. We were actually happy it broke and with a new purchase, also determined to get away from teflon and non-stick which by some accounts off-gasses at 500 degrees, which is a little too close for comfort for my liking. Others say 700 degrees.<br /><br />For that reason, this unit didn't even make my first shortlist, also unfamiliarity with the brand. Unfortunately, in my hunt to transition away from non-stick, I discovered that with the exception of the Waring, they're all non-stick. You can get about 4 of the Waring for the price of this, so it's in a different class with fewer features, but the Waring also has no digital controls, which to those of us who suffer frequent &#34;brown outs&#34; and power surges that can fry the LEDs is a plus.<br /><br />In the end, we traded those concerns and 4 times the $ for this for all the reasons other reviewers have highlighted. No need to repeat unnecessarily, only to say that so far I'm extremely pleased I made this choice, at least if 2 days of use to use toast, bagel and convection reheat functions are a reasonable measure. Results have been nothing short of perfect out of the box. Easy to use, intuitive controls, perfect results, quiet, good audio alerts, wonderful pull out rack feature, ease of access to the crumb tray from outside the unit at the front, smart looks. Heaven.<br /><br />However, there is a reason I deducted the 1 star. Be aware that this oven has NO INTERIOR LIGHT or ON/OFF POWER BUTTON!!! Yes, that's right, all these amazing features, and the high ticket price, yet no interior oven light to see the food!!!! No way to switch the unit off completely without pulling out the cord from the wall, otherwise it's permanently on standby mode when not in use.<br /><br />Maybe I'll get used to it, but for this price I don't think I should have to keep a flashlight by the unit to see the state of the food. We've mitigated the risk of the potential LED damage by adding a socket surge protector, but for this price, I think I should be able to switch the unit off completely without physically having to pull it out to get to the socket and pull out the cord. Something to be aware of.<br /><br />These issues are not annoying enough to make me want to trade this unit right now, I'm otherwise totally thrilled with it, and highly recommend. I reserve the right to come back and post-edit this review after a longer period of ownership.se.<br /><br />Maybe I'll get used to it, but for this price I don't think I should have to keep a flashlight by the unit to see the state of the food.

That's what they don't tell you until you use it awhile.<br />The quality of the foods prepared in the Breville is excellent.  Toast is excellent -- just plan ahead, it takes awhile.  At least it estimates how long so that you can cook your eggs and meats while leisurely waiting.<br />Roasts are also perfect -- Nice rare center, crisp outside crust.  Just add some cooking time to your recipe and have a glass of wine.<br />Broiling requires keeping the meat close to the top and I rarely use 400 degrees -- 500 is more time effective.<br />I use convection on most dishes.  Use low cook pans to promote the air flow for convection.  Amazingly, the &#34;pulsing heat&#34; reduces the splatter experienced in most wall ovens.  A temperature probe showed only 274 degrees with it set to 290 but the meat was thoroughly cooked 33 minutes instead of 25 -- not too bad.

As other reviewers have indicated, its temperature accuracy is very good.  And I like very much the fact that in most modes the temperature can be set very low (120 degrees) to keep food warm or warm up plates.  The convection feature is nice and in general for things where even heating is not important it works well.<br /><br />Then there's that &#34;even heating&#34; thing... the &#34;leading consumer magazine&#34; everyone references gave this thing a &#34;very good&#34; rating for toasting.  Personally, I give it a &#34;very bad&#34; rating.  If I follow the instructions to the letter (selecting the correct # of slices on the control panel and placing the bread just so inside the unit), when one area of the top of toast is just about to turn black, other areas will be barely dark at all, and the underside of the bread will hardly be toasted at all.  My 40 year old GE &#34;toast-r-oven&#34; does WAY better at making toast.<br /><br />Likewise, cooking frozen pizza in this thing is an exercise in frustration.  The outside always cooks much more than the middle.<br /><br />And unfortunately, toast and frozen pizza are the things I'd use this oven for most, if it was any good with them.  For the money, I just expected better.<br /><br />Update 3/2015 after 9 months of ownership: I still like the things I mentioned above... temperature accuracy, ability to set very low temps (it's great as a plate warmer).  But there are also some things about it that are very annoying.<br /><br />First, and I'll admit this is not a huge problem but it's annoying, after a period of time when not in use the oven goes into a &#34;sleep mode&#34; and will &#34;wake&#34; whenever you push a button or move a control.  The problem is it takes several seconds for that to happen.  You walk up to the thing, rotate the &#34;function&#34; knob to select what you want it to do, and nothing happens.  You have to wait a few seconds and move the knob again.  That's just dumb and it wastes time when you're hurrying to prepare a meal.<br /><br />Second: it takes forever to heat up.  Almost 10 minutes from cold to 400 degrees.  I understand as a 120V plug-in appliance it can't have the wattage of a full-sized oven, but it's also got less than 1/10 the interior volume.  It just shouldn't take that long to heat.<br /><br />And the worst thing: a couple of months after we got it, it developed a really annoying rattle whenever the convection fan is running.  It's not super loud but is really annoying.<br /><br />So in summary as I said at the top, I don't think this thing is total junk, but expected a whole lot better for the price.d nothing happens.

We called Breville and they quickly sent a replacement.  The second oven was also about 15-20 degrees lower than the set temperature, needless to say a big disappointment!  Breville again responded quickly and politely and sent us a third oven.  This one maintains the correct temperature, finally!  For such a well made oven, we don't understand why they don't use a quality, accurate thermostat.

It is rather annoying to have that bright LED panel stay on so long after. The door closure has no force attenuation - if you let it go, it slams back shut loudly and heavily. For such a premium price, the oven should have had such a design improvement. The provided accessories are nice, but a second rack would have been nice.<br /><br />An additional comment/suggestion: the various combinations of the upper and lower heating elements for the various heating/cooking functions do an adequate job as designed, but not as good as it ought to be for such a premium price.

I purchased a new oven from Breville at a discount (free shipping) and used that one sparingly (I was out of town most of this time) for about 3 months when things started going south. It would beep as though it had reached temperature and then turn itself off! It wouldn't turn back on for days but the same problem occurred the next 3 times I tried to use it. I called Breville and they gave me numerous excuses but agreed to replace the oven.

We love these ovens and now that my wife and I have been empty nesters for five years or so cook in our little Breville oven 90% of the meals that we prepare in an oven. After around 7 years of medium-duty use, the convection fan went out in it. Not a huge deal. We heard it making noises for a year before it (convection fan) finally gave up the ghost. We continued to use it without convection and it worked fine. A year ago the door spring that keeps the oven door closed went out causing the door to fall open once in a great while. Anyway, we're on our second one now and believe that 8 years of use is all you can ask for any appliance that you use regularly so i will still give it 4 stars. By the way, our daughter and her husband took the old one, cleaned it up real nice and is now using it for their family of five. They called Breville to see about getting it repaired and Breville told them it would be $100 to fix &#34;ANYTHING that is wrong with it&#34;. That's a pretty good deal.

When I roast a chicken (a small broiler-fryer fits beautifully) it comes out moist and golden brown in record time. It's the best thing ever for reheating leftovers or preparing frozen foods. For a single person or a small family (there are 3 of us), it's really ideal. After 2 years of daily use, it still works beautifully and has been worth every penny it cost.

The Breville BOV800XL, however, is a horse of a completely different feather.  This is like the Lexus (or pick your fav luxury vehicle) of toaster ovens.  I'm not a cook.  That is, I have avoided cooking most of my life except on a very limited basis.  But eating out all the time has gotten extremely boring not to mention expensive, so I figured, why not invest in something that I might actually use?  Enter the Breville. Beautifully designed (for the most part; I'll get to that).  So far, I've baked up chicken legs, salmon, bacon, grilled cheese sandwiches, English muffins, toast and I've got many more plans for it in the coming months.<br /><br />Make no mistake: this sucker is big.  So if counter-top space is at a premium, that could be an issue.  But I WANTED a big one; one that i could bake a 13&#34; pizza in without having to chop it up into smaller pieces.  Sure, I burned one of my pizzas and last night I set off the smoke alarm trying to bake some chicken with the heat turned up too high.  That's not the fault of the Breville; that's the doins of a not-too-smart cook.<br /><br />The only actual quibble I have--and this quibble almost caused me to take a star away except for the fact that everything else is so great about it--is that the knobs feel kind of cheap and wobbly.  Should they ever break off (or whatever), I would then definitely remove a star.  But for now, I am so impressed with it that I think it is well worth the expense.  And yes, it is that: expensive, but it does what it does so well.",2015-01-08
US,36409307,RK5V4Y3WKA9XB,B001L5TVGW,608011455,Breville BOV800XL Smart Oven 1800-Watt Convection Toaster Oven with Element IQ,Kitchen,1.0,19.0,21.0,N,N,DANGER!!! OVEN EXPLODES! GLASS DOOR BLOWS LIKE A BOMB!,"OMG! OMG! I'M GENUINELY THANKFUL TO BE ALIVE!<br />I was so thrilled to finally buy the \\""awesome\\"" Breville Toaster Oven. After reading the whole instruction book I used it 5 or 6 times.  I was baking a small dish of home fries and bent down to check it, looking directly through the glass. I was at absolute eye level, 3 inches from the glass door.  I walked a few steps & within 4 seconds there was this monster explosion and the glass door blew out!  It literally blew into thousands & thousands of pieces in every direction. Months later I was still finding tiny pieces of chards I had missed when cleaning that got into every crack in far away places. I remain shocked at how far, high and low they went because of how intense the explosion was.  It blew with killer pressure.  I am hugely grateful to still have my face and eyes and my life itself. The damn stove scared me to my bones--justifiably so.<br /><br />If there were a light inside, as even the cheapest $29 microwave has, I never would have had to put my nose so close to the door.<br /><br />I just read Margaret's report of having THE EXACT SAME EXPLOSION, and another one that said door explosions are not at all unusual with the this unit. (Wow...) What troubles me greatly is that Customer Service told me (the supervisor of the whole department...) that this has \\""Never! Never!\\"" happened.  Apparently this is not true. It is a well known issue.<br /><br />Without any embellishment I could have been killed if it was only a mere 4 seconds before, entirely blinded, or my throat and face cut & lacerated from the countless knifelike chards of exploding glass.<br /><br />Customer Service kindly replaced the unit. The oven itself does have many great features, but I probably would have gotten a refund if I knew how often other people also had exploding doors.  The rep I worked with convinced me I was the only one this has ever happened to. Using the replacement oven would get a great report from me except for 3 difficult things, the worst of which is that it has a major, nasty cold spot. I was so nervous about the explosion I was \\""afeared\\"" I might get another internally dangerous unit, so I decided to keep the 2nd one, even though it doesn't work completely right. (At least it was unlikely to explode).  I have come to wonder if they sent a refurbished one as replacement tho I paid full cost?<br /><br />Because of the cold spot, baking/broiling is very uneven and you must tend everything frequently.  I baked muffins yesterday. Identical batter levels. Tops of some were over-browning, moving towards burning while the ones in the back right of the stove had raw tops. This happens every time. When broiling similar size pieces of chicken the left side is close to charring, while the right rear corner is skin raw. Gone is the convenience of just setting the timer and letting things bake with only 1 or 2 checks before time's up.<br /><br />But imagine this: I am afraid of a damn toaster oven!  I feel the need to treat it timidly and certainly never allow my head to get close to the front.  (As I would recommend to all).  If it had a light in it I never would have had to put my head so close to see how the back of the pan was baking. You can't see in, and in deadly accurate fact, just looking in through the glass could be  life threatening.<br /><br />Margaret, Thank you so much for posting. Even tho this was a terrible event, both you and I are very, (very!) lucky people.<br /><br />RATINGS: The first exploding Breville gets Zero stars. My second one, the one I now live with gets 3 stars.<br /><br />CONS:  1. Uneven cooking with large cold spot.  2. No, (desperately needed) interior light.  3. Interior Stainless steel in oven & drip pan are very low quality. They scratch easily & permanently, moreso than any common stainless steel. The outside case is a better grade SS.<br /><br />This COULD BE a great oven. The good features are indeed excellent, but the bad ones are major, with time consuming set backs.",2015-01-07

So I thought, why not get a simple model - I went to Costco and was about to bite the bullet on the Kitchenaid but thought about doing some actual research. I read through forums/reviews, scoped out models, went to big box stores to look - this became a full on project.<br /><br />I thought, I have enough counter space, why not get something a little bigger so I can cook a whole frozen pizza, or creme brulee - i mean, doesn't it seem silly to turn on the big oven for a little ramekin of goodness? How did I come across this? Well -  Breville has been good to me over the years, everything I've purchased from them has always worked, and worked well, lasted and easy to maintain and use. I was excited to have placed my order and even more eager to try it out. The first thing I made in this - well nothing. I had to do the test run to burn off any ickies - per the instructions and yes, there was a little stink initially and we were a little concerned.<br /><br />Our first test - MEATBALLS! What normally takes me 20 minutes to prep on the stove and then another 30 minutes in the oven is no longer needed. I threw the meatballs in the baking pan provided - set the machine at 375 and timer for 20 minutes - it came out perfect - the outside had a nice caramelization and the inside was juicy and delish.<br /><br />Creme brulee - the best I've ever made. I've roasted some beef skewers, heated pizza of course (and it's perfect).<br /><br />This machine is a little smaller than my microwave. It's so far the most used appliance in the house. My family thought this purchase was nuts at first due to the price tag - but now they love it. Since it's energy efficient - I'm sure I'll reap the benefits of a lowered electric bill - and not having to turn on a giant oven that heats up the entire house.e.",2015-01-06

I received an Oster toaster oven for Christmas and unfortunately, the print on the oven was very hard to read, so I had to return it. How can you use it if you have to get a magnifying glass out in order to read the settings? Thus begin my search for a new toaster oven.  I went online and read a number of reviews and researched everything I could find.  The obvious conclusion was the Breville Smart Oven with Element IQ but I just couldn't bring myself to spend $250 for one.  I tried to find the next best thing and I considered a Kenmore Elite but couldn't really find anything on it.  It appears that reviewers seem to leave this brand out.  Anyway, it could be good but didn't want to take a chance, so I settled on the Cuisinart TOB-260.  This really seemed like one that was comparable to the Breville but $50.00 less and it had a 3 year warranty. After receiving it dented, scratched, looking used and with the pizza stone broken, I returned it.  If I wanted to wait until February, I could get a replacement from Amazon, so I opted for a refund instead.  I searched my local stores and other online retailers and this Cuisinart model seemed to be out of stock everywhere.  When I talked to someone at Best Buy, they said this model had been discontinued. This brought up questions in my mind about why it had been discontinued and if this model wasn't as good as I first thought.  I started considering the Breville again but the price kept bothering me.<br /><br />What's a girl to do?  Well, to make a long story short, I signed-up online with Bed, Bath and Beyond to receive email offers etc..  As a first time email customer, you get a 20% coupon for one item and it's emailed to you within 24 hours.  I then went to my local Bed, Bath & Beyond store and bought the Breville.  With the 20% coupon, I saved $50.00!  I was one happy girl!  I've only had it for a couple of days now and i've only made frozen pizza and English muffins.  The pizza turned out perfect!  No burnt edges or soggy not cooked in the middle pizza with this oven.  I adjusted the time to 10 minutes and this worked beautifully.  Also, English muffins where toasted on 4 and they were nice and crispy and not to dark. It's digital, easy to read as well as easy to use. If I had one complaint, it would be with the preheating feature and how there is no alarm to let you know when it's finished.  If you are not there in front of it, it will start counting down for whatever process you selected.  You have to put the food in and stop/start again.  I know it's a minor irritant but thought I would throw that in.  Overall, so far, I'm extremely happy with this toaster convection oven and would highly recommend it.No burnt edges or soggy not cooked in the middle pizza with this oven.

It does get hot especially on top but all these type ovens do. as long as you are aware of that it will not keep you from touching it during and after use till cool.  each recipe I have tried had turned out just as described. Here is a shortcut to the chicken recipe I cooked.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GeHo6S1DW4  copy and paste it in your browser..there are many youtube videos here you can watch on this website. videos of actual cooks making recipes in this oven. that was a plus for me as I had not used this type of appliance much and needed some pointer.

It is large for a toaster oven. It really should be named mini-oven and not toaster oven. Because while it toasts, it's construction and heating are those of an actual oven. I used it as a 3rd oven to bake casseroles at Thanksgiving. I've made pastries, rolls, heated pizza. The temperature modulation is amazing, and better than my wall ovens. It makes perfect toast, not kidding. The toast is perfectly toasted on both sides every time. The cookie setting produces perfect cookies. Again, not kidding. I am very happy I paid the extra money for this oven. It has these wonderful back stops to prevent it from getting too close to a wall while heating, of course those make it sit out on the counter a little farther, but I'm very glad for them because I tend to push stuff back. This oven is so sturdy and well made, it makes me feel safe. On the front of the door glass there is a little guide that instructs on which level to set the rack for different items. When I first saw it I sort of scoffed, but I use the guide all the time and it's very helpful. As a con, it is definitely larger and it takes up more space on the counter, but then it is a mini-oven. The only other negative, and it's barely a negative, is that the tray slides out with the door--which I actually enjoy--but then the door doesn't really push the tray back in so I have to set stuff down to close the oven door. Not a deal breaker. And I like the tray sliding out making it easier for me to remove the hot items.  I highly recommend this toaster oven.",2014-12-12

After 48 years of faithful service, my gas wall oven gave up the ghost, about three weeks before Thanksgiving. No problem, I figured - went to Sears, ordered a new model wall oven with installation in plenty of time for the holiday - but Sears isn't what is used to be (that's a whole other story for another time), and with less than a week to go before the holiday, with 14 guests expected at my house, I had no oven. Too late to cancel the dinner and that's not my style anyway.  Adapt, improvise and overcome - that's what I opted for.  Decided to use the outdoor grill for the turkey (and that worked out awesome - going to be my go-to turkey roasting method going forward.)  Adapted as many sides as I could to be cooked on the stovetop.  And for those things that just had to be baked and wouldn't fit on a grill occupied by a pretty big turkey, I went to Amazon and ordered this little puppy from Breville.  I had my doubts, but let me tell you, it did the job great.  It arrived on Wednesday, and I had it baking all that night and all the next day -- cookies, pies, rolls, sweet potato casserole with bacon topping, sausage stuffing, baked hors d'ouevres, you name it.  It was a bit of a challenge keeping everything warm to be served at the same time, but we managed.  More than managed - it was one of the better meals I've put together, and I couldn't have done it without this Little Oven That Could.  Could not be happier with it.  If you can, order the bamboo cutting board that fits on top - it comes in handy and stays nice and cool no matter how hot the oven gets.",2014-12-07

It does, particularly for small baking jobs. But the best thing about this model compared to the compact is it actually heats up to the advertised temperature. The Compact Smart Oven was supposed to reach 450F, but could barely make it to 425F and the actual oven temperature was consistently lower than the display indicated. This one, if you set it to 450F, that's how hot it gets. But as with most ovens you can't completely trust the display. On this model the display shows &#34;Preheating&#34; while the oven is coming up to temp. When set to 450F preheating supposedly ended after less than 3 minutes, but it took a total of 8 minutes for my very reliable oven thermometer to indicate 450, and that's without a pizza stone or anything else inside.

Because it's convection, it also won't dry out the items as a normal oven would when you have it on warm.  Even though I cook daily, I find myself now almost exclusively only using this one due to the time savings and the results.  Because there is no large family here, it's perfect for almost everything I do and in many cases far better than my fancy-pants old school oven.  It heats up so fast I have pretty much broken up with my oven and microwave.<br /><br />PLATE WARMER:<br /><br /> And speaking of hot plates, the top of this one is a built-in plate warmer.  So, like a restaurant that does not serve you a hot dish on a cold plate since that equals a tepid dish very quickly, put your ceramic or glass plate on top while you cook your dish and your plate is warm to the touch when serving.<br /><br />CONVECTION OVEN:<br /><br />So let's talk convection oven. Regular ovens heat by the heating elements whereas convection ovens also blow the heated air around the oven cabin to result in faster cooking with more even results and a crisp outside while retaining all moisture inside.  That's great if you eat meat, but there is no better oven for baking because you get perfect crumb and crust like you just can't get in any regular oven that's not convection.  Breads are moist and springy and perfect inside (perfect crumb) with a great crust outside.  Cookies are tender yet have a bit of a crisp on the outside.  True pro cooking.  Because convection ovens also speed up cooking time, I often also lower the recipe directions by 25 degrees. The convection setting is optional. It's default for some cooking settings but if for some reason you want to ride out the baking time old-school cooking, just press the \\""convection\\"" button and you can turn that on or off.<br /><br />TOASTER HEAVEN:<br /><br />I ditched the toaster.  If you take 2 pieces of toast and make a sandwich you get a very dry sandwich.  However, you can put the entire sandwich in here and get melty cheese, hot insides, the most perfect crisping on the outside that I have seen in ages, and still not have it dry on the inside.  This has become my addiction--fancy Sammys.  There is a reason Subway uses toaster ovens for their hot sandwiches.  You can't melt cheese in your toaster.<br /><br />AUTOMATIC SHUT-OFF:<br /><br />There are several pre-programmed settings but no matter what you set it on, it turns off automatically for you when it's done.  Your regular oven can't do that trick.  So if you want to go about your business and go upstairs and vacuum or do laundry and are away from the oven--no worries, when the timer goes off or the automatic cooking time goes off, so does your oven.  Of course, if you want more time, you can just hit the start button again if something takes longer to cook but this is a safety and convenience feature.<br /><br />COOKING IQ:<br /><br />If you are not aware of this part, and you are testing your oven temp,you might do it wrong.  First, I want to point out that you have to leave an oven thermometer in for 30 minutes to get an accurate reading.  As a chef I frequently check my ovens for accuracy both at home and work and this one never fails...always accurate.  So back to IQ. What is it?  It does things to ensure what you are baking exceeds expectations so if you do your part, you'll get great results.  For example, on the toast setting it asks you how many pieces.  If you input one you'll get the heating elements just in the center of the oven.  Put in 4 and you get the whole oven but it pulses the heat in order to not overdry out your bread while toasting.  Really the best toast ever.  On toast it does this on the top and bottom of the oven, whereas you can put a bagel or English muffin in on the bagel setting and you get less toasting on the bagel bottom where it's already cooked so it does not dry out. Smart, huh?<br /><br />CELSIUS RECIPE CONVERSION:<br /><br />Set this up wrong and you will always wonder why your oven is the wrong temperature.  It has F and C cooking. What's great about that is that you can use any recipe you find online even if it's from another country and written all in Celsius.  Push the button and all the temps are C.  Push again and back to Fahrenheit .  So it's an instant recipe converter.  But if you feel your oven is running wrong temp, look for the F after the number and be sure you didn't push the button.<br /><br />FROZEN FOODS BUTTON:<br /><br />Are you cooking from one of the pre-set easy settings but your items is frozen? For example, if you want to pull a bagel out of the freezer to toast it?  Just push the \\""frozen\\"" button first and it automatically warms up the item and adds the extra time to your toaster setting so you don't get crispy outside and frozen middle or undercooked or undertoasted.  You can add this to any setting like the pizza setting.<br /><br />RACK PLACEMENT SMARTS:<br /><br />The outside of the oven door tells you where to position the rack for proper cooking. For example, if you are broiling, you will want a different setting than if you are toasting. It is easy to forget this on regular toaster ovens and get poor results because of it.  Just look at the small guages on the right of the glass and you will never make a mistake. Top rack height position is for broil, middle rack is for toast, bagel, pizza, and cookie functions.  The bottom rack height is for bake, roast, reheat and warm functions<br /><br />REHEAT FOODS WITHOUT DRYING OUT:<br /><br />Got leftovers but don't want to dry them out while cooking again?  You don't have to.  Choose the \\""reheat\\"" setting.  It will reheat your foods but will not brown the top since that has already been done.<br /><br />MAGNETIC AUTO-EJECT RACK:<br /><br />Why didn't all oven manufacturers think of that?  There are two magnets on the back side of the oven door, when you open the door, the magnets automatically pull the oven rack out for you so you don't have to REACH IN and grab your hot food or cheese toast.  Really great if you have kids on the go grabbing something--safety first and no more burns and I usually don't even need an oven mitt if juts grabbing my toast or sandwich.<br /><br />CUSTOMIZED TOAST BROWNING:<br /><br />Pick how many slices and how brown you want your toast and it will automatically return to that setting the next time and display it.  Should you vary the number of slices often, just one turn of the dial will give you a new number so it's easy to change that up as you cook.  The pulsing ensures you simply can't get better toasting.<br /><br />BAGEL FUNCTION:<br /><br />Top and bottom elements cycle on and off but you'll get a tad more browning on top where the bagel is totally uncooked with a perfectly crisped base where it's already browned.  All other toast options are the same as the toast options as far as auto-memory etc.<br /><br />BAKE:<br /><br />It will default for cooking convection 325 for 30 minutes.  It should be noted that that's 350 in a regular oven.  The hot air circulates the heat so you get faster cooking so adjust all recipes by 25 degrees.  You will far prefer the results of convection baking to a regular oven but that is why it defaults to 325 rather than 350.  To increase temp or time, just one roll of the top and bottom knob does that.  You can also turn off the convection baking if you want.  Just push the \\""convection\\"" button.  I never turn that off while in the baking mode.  Regular baking can't do what convection can as far as better results.<br /><br />ROAST FUNCTION:<br /><br />Top and bottom elements cycle on and off to get the correct temp overall but middle element is off so as not to dry out.  It is suggested the max weight to roast be 4.5 lbs for best results.  Also, many like to roast poultry in juices that contain lemon.  Citric acid damages broiling pans of toaster ovens so line yours in foil if you use anything with citric acid or lemon juice.<br /><br />BROIL:<br /><br />While the top rack is suggested, this is a guide. You can also brown the tops of casseroles by having the wire rack lower.  It still works.  You can melt cheese on your sandwiches on broil, or crisp something up. You can even broil seatood, meats, and veggies.  On this setting you want to use the broil rack.  That's the rack that sits inside the baking pan that came with it. Use them both.  It has slats in it but is not as open as your wire rack.  This way, melting cheese, oil, etc that you have won't drip onto the base of the oven but air will circulate through those vents in the rack.<br /><br />PIZZA:<br /><br />It does a really great pizza and I highly recommend the pizza stone that's an option for this oven.  To use a pizza stone, don't ever wash it.  It will wind up getting seasoned (black from cooking on it) in time but the high temp kills off bacteria...always scrape it after use, don't wash a pizza stone.  The seasoning will make it non-stick eventually but until then, just throw a little cornstarch on it.  You want to heat the pizza stone up WITH the oven. Don't put it in the oven cold with the pizza.  It won't work.  The point of a pizza stone is to crisp up the crust and so heating it up as you preheat the oven makes it do that.  I have a pizza oven so I never thought I'd use my toaster oven for that.  I thought I might use it for frozen pizza now and again so I bought the stone.  But now I love it!  You can put it on the \\""fresh\\"" setting and use dough or your can put it on the \\""frozen\\"" setting for store bought frozen pizzas.  It asks you the approximate size in order to use it's smart technology to heat perfectly.  I do recommend the pizza's suggested temperature of 450 at convection for great results.  You can just pop it in and put the size and it will automatically tell you how long it thinks you should cook it at that temp.,  Of course you can always change that.<br /><br />COOKIE FUNCTION:<br /><br />Use the convection on this one. It comes on as default but you can't get better cookies than your convection oven.  It also does perfect biscuits, cinnamon rolls, croissants, etc.  You can cook from frozen cookie dough simply by pushing the \\""frozen\\"" button.  I recommend getting some silicone baking sheets.  You can cut them to any size you want and then your cookies never stick to the baking pans you use and you need no grease.  I use them whether I make cookies in the oven or in the toaster oven but it's nice for the toaster oven since you need small pans and they often are not as well made so you get flawless non-stick from them.<br /><br />EASY CLEAN-UP:<br /><br />The bottom pan pulls out so you don't have to do the cleaning by reaching into the oven.  You can also line that with the non-stick foil but I have not found the need to as it cleans up easily.  I throw the racks in the dishwasher for anything that drips onto those.  You are not supposed to put the broiler pan in the dishwasher though.  I handwashthe cookie sheet because I want it to build up non-stick seasoning.  It may be dishwasher safe though; I just know never to put any cookie pan in the dishwasher if you want it non-stick.<br /><br />KEEP WARM:<br /><br />When I am having a dinner party I use this often.  I can bake a loaf of bread or a side dish and have it done while I begin other dishes.  I set it in the toaster oven on the warming setting and the heat cycles on and off with convection air  That means it does not dry out the dish, but it keeps it hot until I am ready to serve it.  I made jalape&ntilde;o bread for a recent Tex/Mex party and the bread was in there a couple hours until I was ready to serve it.  It came out hot and fresh and moist and perfect as though I'd just taken it out of the oven.  You never have to worry about perfect timing again.  Of course, this also means that you can cook dinner for the kids when your spouse works late, and keep their meal hot until they arrive home and everyone eats happy with hot fresh dinners.<br /><br />That's my recap having been using mine for some time now.  I had no idea how toaster ovens had changed and how invaluable one would wind up being to me.  Cooking time is reduced considerably as is clean up and during the holidays I have a full extra oven for that casserole so all my foods are timed perfectly no matter what is in the other oven.  I thought I'd use it some but I have rarely used my pro full-size oven since and I actually have nearly broken up with my microwave.  I can preheat the whole oven in a couple minutes and since it's convection, everything cooks better so I now only use my regular oven for large baking for parties.  Everything else is done in this one.  Including meals I used to microwave.<br /><br />Easy clean up, great features, this one is simply a winner.oven but that is why it defaults to 325 rather than 350.

Second, This toaster oven SUCKS!<br /><br />Here are the details: We got our toaster oven and like so many others, the oven just quit. Unlike so many others, it quit within the first month we owned it. My wife called customer service, was put on hold for half an hour before hanging up. Other people have also experienced the piss-poor customer service that Breville has to offer. In short - as long as you don't have to get the oven repaired (under warranty) - you'll be fine and the oven is the best I've seen. If, however, you need it to get repaired... good luck!<br /><br />But wait ... this oven isn't made as cheap as others. It isn't rivetted together, but screwed. There are tons of screws, but if you have basic electrical experience (e.g. you know how to change a light switch without getting shocked) and do your research, you can replace the broken parts. In my case it was the thermal fuse, which it turns out is the root cause 90 percent of the time when the unit just quits working. The part was acquired at Radio Shack for a couple of bucks and took about two hours to put into the toaster. Now it works like new again.<br /><br />If you also experience issues with this toaster, post a reply and I'll see what I can do to help. One poor guy decided to send in the toaster to get it fixed by Breville because it broke down a few days after the warranty - they wanted $118 to repair it... that's half the price of the toaster itself!<br /><br />When browsing the web, I noticed that in 2010 they were quick to respond and help... but something changed between then and 2012 to where they are now one of the worst companies to deal with. Maybe enough people caught on to how their appliances were breaking down too quickly and the onslaught of repair requests shamed them into hiding ... who knows.

Will easily accommodate most frozen pizzas. It takes a little getting used to for toast. I find the toast setting does better for bagels than the bagel setting.<br /><br />I like having a second convection oven in the kitchen, which is how I bake most things, so I get a nice crust on the outside, but moist on the inside, no matter what I'm baking. However, I have noticed that the right side (closer to the convection fan) tends to brown faster than the left side. I compensate by rotating the pan halfway through the cooking time, which is good practice regardless.<br /><br />I've used it to bake a number of things, but I'll avoid baking things that may splatter, because it's not easy to clean the splattered grease from inside the oven, especially around and under the heating elements. That being said, the front access to the crumb tray is very nice, making it relatively easy to clean out.<br /><br />I like that the oven goes through a pre-heat cycle when baking, but when it reaches the set temperature and beeps, it immediately starts the cooking timer. I would like it if you could pre-heat it, when it beeps telling me it's ready to put the food in the oven, I can then put the food in the oven I can set the cook timer, or start the timer if pre-set. Since it doesn't do that, I compensate by reducing the cook time 2-3 minutes and put the food in at the start so it begins cooking during the pre-heat cycle.<br /><br />For the cost, I feel that the selector, temperature/doneness, and slices/time controls were better made. There seems to be some slippage when selecting the different modes and the other settings. Feels somewhat cheap. I would expect a better feel when selecting and turning the knobs, similar to the controls of most audio receivers.<br /><br />So overall I'm giving it 4 stars because of it's size and functionality. I'd give it 5 stars if the controls felt more like a top of the line toaster oven should feel. Also, if I didn't have to compensate and adjust my cooking methods to adapt to the design. Breville has some really good ideas and produces some outstanding products, but this one could be a little better. However, I still feel it's the best toaster oven on the market, with some room for improvement. I would definitely recommend it, but would also let them know that it's not perfect.and adjust my cooking methods to adapt to the design.

I called Breville customer service, and was offered a 20% discount on a new model or, secondarily, I can send it out and  have it repaired for one hundred and twenty dollars.  It is obviously out of the one year warranty, so I didn't expect much from customer service.  What I *did* expect was this pricey oven to last way more than two years.

It works well although I don't notice much difference between this and my Black and Decker convection oven.  Perhaps with more use I would notice the difference.  We use our toaster oven for almost everything as we don't use a microwave.  I have to send the defective one back and I am undecided about whether to try another one of these or something else.

More to come in a few months.,"When the old B&D oven crapped out, we were about to buy another one but then decided to peruse Amazon to see what people were buying.  The Breville is where we landed.  I must admit I'm still a little nervous about this stoves longevity based on reviews , but for now I'm just enjoying how well it cooks and looks.  First Impressions::<br /><br />PROS<br />1.  Nice looking on the counter top<br />2.  The toast presets as well as others are very convenient<br />3.  Mechanically,  it appears to be put together very well. No rattling<br />4.  Not as countertop intrusive on a 24&#34; space as I thought it might be considering how big the interior is<br />5.  Display is clear and there are no issues with readability.<br />6.  Very nice manual<br />7.  Well packaged for shipping,  triple boxed if you count the factory box<br />8.  No more warming up fried food in the microwave and ending up with wet goo.  It does good on things that a microwave messes up.<br />9.  Allows me to not heat up the whole kitchen with the new Capital Precision Stove.<br />10.  The heating elements can throttle which is why it cooks so well.  The controller can vary power to the elements for precise control.<br /><br />CONS<br />1.  I took off 1 star because the rotary controls just feel cheap and grainy as other have said.  I think the manf could have spent a little more on some better internals here.<br />2.  Gets hot all over.  If you really crank it up , you can burn your knuckles with an overhand grip opening the door.  There are standoffs for clearance behind it,  but you better have some good countertop material behind it if you push it to the wall.<br />3.  I can see how these things could burn out the electronics or thermal overload with lots of use in high temp oven mode,  The fan does dual use for convection and cooling the electronics.  When it turns off, there is no temp control to keep the fan running until the oven cools down.  A better design would have incorporated a $5 temp switch to keep the fan running. Otherwise,  the heat soak eventually heats up the electronics.  Probably a reason for the failures that you read about.<br /><br />In conclusion ,  I need more run time to see how it holds up.  Cooking performance is where it excels.  Longevity experience will come in  report down the road.to keep the fan running. Otherwise,  the heat soak eventually heats up the electronics.

I have no complaints about the functionality of the unit.  That said, it is not a reliable unit and unless you want to buy a new one every couple of years I would recommend buying something else.  We bought this unit just 2 and a half years ago.  Used it on a regular basis and it worked great.  We noticed that pizzas, toast, etc. started coming out not fully cooked and noticed that the bottom heating elements were not working.  I called Breville and was told that I could have it repaired for $119 (over half of what I originally paid) or they would give me 20% off a new one (basically the same deal I can get at my local Bed, Bath and Beyond with a coupon).  I replaced a 17 year old Black and Decker basic toaster oven with this Breville convection oven at almost 10 times the cost and it only lasted 2.5 years!!  Ridiculous.  I called a local repair center to see if they could repair it for less than the $119 and he said he couldn't and said that he sees this quite often with Breville toaster ovens.  He said once the bottom elements go out the upper ones will also likely go out soon.  Not worth the money.  Oh, and I did try going through two or three customer service reps, asking for supervisors, etc. in the hopes that someone at the company would finally be willing to exchange my unit and nothing worked.  I am usually as polite as can be when talking to service reps.  Maybe I was too polite!

For the price of this oven, they should really have gone the extra mile and made it all stainless. Another alternative would have used a black trim to differentiate between that and the real stainless. Otherwise, a few burnt on splatters completely ruins the look of this gorgeous oven.

Based on the reviews, I ordered this model and just got it 2 days ago. I LOVE this little oven - it's like having a full size oven in compact size. So far I have made biscuits, shortcakes and broiled fish in it - each one was perfect. SOOO easy to use this for small servings rather than run the big oven.<br /><br />Instructions were clear and easy to understand, functions are user friendly. This is larger than my last toaster oven and I really appreciate the extra size. It holds my quarter sheet pans perfectly. The convection fan is quiet and so is the \\""beep\\"" telling you the cooking is done or the oven is pre-heated. It pre-heats VERY quickly - about 2 minutes.<br /><br /> Having made shortcakes in my big convection oven, this seems spot on  temperature wise - but actually cooked the shortcakes to a more even golden brown rather than dark \\""peaks\\"" sometimes left by my big oven. Very, very pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />Because this is larger than the typical toaster oven, I opted to order the bamboo topper for it - glad I did. It looks nice and allows me to store things up there or like tonight, put the finished shortcakes up there while I made the whipped cream.<br /><br />Update 09/21/2014: I borrowed a very accurate H-B Industries industrial grade thermometer from a deli manager to check all my ovens. I set this oven at 5 different temperatures - 275, 325, , 350, 400 and 450. I let each cycle run 20 minutes for testing. This little oven is a mere 10 degrees colder than the temperature control - and each temperature was maintained consistently, both on the convection setting and conventional. Haven't tested the other ovens yet, but my suspicion is this one will prove to be the most accurate and most consistent.<br /><br />So far, the only cons I can find on this oven is that there is no interior light - but my last 2 toaster ovens had no light either.  My GE convection/microwave beeps to let you know it's pre-heated, holds the that temp and keeps reminding you until you set your time for cooking. The Breville starts counting the time down right away. If you're not right there to put the dish you're cooking into the oven, the time has to be re-set. Neither is a big deal - just musing on how I would design it!eated, holds the that temp and keeps reminding you until you set your time for cooking.

I accidentally missed my window for buying an extended warranty so fingers crossed I don't need to but i would replace this oven 'that day' if and when it ever fails. It has some quirks that i'd remove a 1/2 star if possible:<br /><br />1) The dial has 'click' detents that have nothing to do with anything; e.g. the dial may 'click' 4 times but only change 2-3 steps; sometimes if you go slow enough you can click 2-3 times before the first update on the screen function<br />2) not sure how to recover baseline presets; once you modify how long or temp for a 'reheat', it keeps your new setting forever; maybe if unplugging it will reset; confirmed! that works; now i just have to re-figure out which ones i don't like the presets (like 'keep warm' should be 130 not 160).<br />3) not sure just HOW but on my brother's copy of the oven i had the rack fall down on my when loading some hot dog buns the other day; the rack has a hook so it won't come out too far so i have no idea how that happened.<br />4) magnet rack puller works only on one level (fortunately the main level) and often causes the rack to jam trying to close the door. minor annoyance but annoyance nonetheless.<br /><br />So, 1/2 star off for the goofiness, it would be nice if the presets somehow had an 'offset' or any way to compare (e.g. 20° cooler, 5 min. 'longer' etc) and the display not following the dial when you turn it which is the biggest annoyance; what the frig is the 'click' for when it doesn't always do an action?action?",2014-09-13

But after having to fork an additional $119 for service after 2 years, I have to honestly downgrade this product. And getting an attitude over the phone because I sent the unit to an authorized service center, stating that I should have contacted them first was a little over the top. And the center told me straight that I had to buy another one as: parts were discontinued, and because you had to replace 2 PCB's, the cost of the repair would be prohibitive.<br /><br />So Breville offer to repair for a fixed price. Another great American product that failed, and pretty much very close to a recall since you will find many other customers which had to go through the same issue. So 250$ plus 25$ for an estimate, plus 119$ for the repair, not adding the days waiting without it = think before buying. Mainly because no one online will confirm in advance if it is from the first version that fails or the revised one. Or buy in a store where you potentially verify the version. I suspect the unit fried after a power outage, suffering from poor power supply design, unable to cope with some surge when the power cam back. never in the world they would accept that this is not an isolated incident and offer to extend the warranty. Good old US, sell first, and get some money down the road anyway you can.<br />Oh and the good part. Breville does not send back the same unit you shipped them. They send you a refurbished unit than comes with some warranty, and the whole set of accessories. Mmmm... what can we do with a second crumb catcher?",2014-09-08

I also rarely agree with the minority views of an item. In this case, both are taking place.<br />The first oven we ordered went through the prescribed preparation routine without a hitch.

On the second use ever!<br />When attempting to reach Breville we were asked if the box had been damaged (it hadn't) and then informed us it would be 3-7 business days for a new one to be sent. To the company's credit, they did send a new one.<br />Quality control must not be a high priority because although this new oven has worked satisfactorily for roughly ten uses, then is a small curlicue of probable styrofoam between the glass of the display and the LED panel. Annoying but not EO-1.<br />Even if this machine works perfectly for the next 20 years, the best rating I can give this item is 3/5. You may want to pursue an alternative first.",2014-09-07

We called Breville customer service and was told it was out of warranty and there was nothing they could do (really nothing they wanted to do).  Given the many related comments, this is a manufacturing defect -- not a warranty issue.  So, now it sits in our storage basement until I just put it out for recycling.  A couple of weeks ago, I was in the market for a great juicer.  I bought the Kuvings Whole Slow Juice for $450.  The Breville was $150 cheaper but I would NEVER buy anther Breville product.

My husband and I looked at several brands before settling on the Breville.  I wanted a basic toaster and an oven that could mostly take the place of the large kitchen oven as we only cook for two.  I also wanted said oven to be large enough to bake occasional loaves of bread and full size meals with ease of use.  My husband wanted quality and a certain esthetic on the counter (he does not do the cooking, he just likes nice things).  I guess the Breville satisfied all requirements.  I can cook and bake pretty much anything I want without the need of an engineering degree as the dials pretty much guide me thru the process, I can adjust the rack level according to the broil, bake or toast position indicated on the outside glass.  The smart oven was very well conceived and feels really high end.  It does not have the steam function like other models out there...  We have looked at those and carefully compared models before purchasing the Breville and although impressed by the advertisings of how perfectly the food comes out each time,  I decided the steam function may not really be worth the mess I would have to clean up.  We decided to stick to our original requirements for now and decide on the steam function with the next Breville as I am sure if it is such a great thing, Breville will come up with one??  Too many choices can really make you agonize over a decision!  You can say this Breville is user friendly and a very nice looking addition to the kitchen counter... oh! and the food does come out perfect every time....",2014-08-28

Yes, I am in LOVE with my oven.  I read multiple reviews and waited a year before purchasing this beauty.  I finally took the plunge and got the Breville for my Birthday and soon discovered what all the fuss was about.  First of all, it took no time at all to figure out all the bells and whistles.  I started out by baking a few things.  It preheated quickly and each of the food items came out perfectly.  I am vegan and baked some fake chickn' nuggets and they were done to perfection (tender and moist on the inside and perfectly crisp on the outside).  I baked a loaf of homemade yeast bread and again it was perfect.  I then cooked whole wheat toast, again the bread was perfectly toasted (crisp on the outside and moist on the inside).  In fact, everything I have cooked has been perfect, which has honestly surprised me.  I feel she (her name is Agnes) has turned me into a first class chef.  I also LOVE the design of this oven.  The crumb tray slides out in a snap for easy cleaning and the brushed nickel finish is very easy to clean and screams highest quality from top to bottom.  When the rack is in the middle position, it is very handy that the magnet in the door partially pulls out the rack for ease of reach.  I am seriously considering unplugging my regular oven for good.  I would no doubt save a bundle on my electric bill.  In short, I highly recommend this oven.  If you are on the fence about buying it, just get off, take the plunge and get it.

I've burned through three toaster ovens of other brands in the past five years because parts always seem to break within a very short time after purchase. I do use them several times a day, but I don't do anything unusual that should be resulting in quick breakage. So I asked around and three different friends told me to try this exact toaster oven because they were so happy with theirs. Two months later, I'm still extremely happy with mine.<br /><br />The door lays open to extract things and the hinge seems sturdy enough that it won't break if you accidentally rest something on it. The crumb tray is very easy to slide out and clean, and really does seem to catch most of the crumbs, unlike the trays in some cheaper ovens. And the elements are easy to clean if something does drip on (that has happened a few times). I take the rack out to wash periodically and it cleans right up, without oils baking irreversibly onto the wires as happens with some cheaper ovens. And the top and glass door clean easily with soap and water wipedowns.<br /><br />I'm also a fan of the controls. I find them to be easy to use and quite intuitive. The selector from the length of time for the toast setting does have a bit of play in it after two months of use, but it doesn't seem to translate into any problem (and I will update my review if it does).",2014-08-15

It preheats very quickly and heats food evenly (it's really hard to find a toaster that will give you an even slice of toast, and you can even convection cook a small chicken in this thing and every part will come out juicy before any of it starts to dry out). It also looks great in my kitchen. I just got mine and I'm still exploring it, but have a feeling this will become my primary oven in short order.<br /><br />A lot of thought clearly went into this. To give you an idea, the manual states: &#34;If the [preheat] alert sounded at 100% of the target temperature, opening the door would mean a lot of this waiting time is &#34;wasted&#34;. We have calculated that by sounding the alert at 75% of the target temperature... we still recover to the target temperature up to 2 minutes faster&#34;.<br /><br />That type of attention to detail and willingness to question conventional wisdom says something about the product.<br /><br />Onto geeky electrical stuff about this oven:<br /><br />One thing to note: at 1800 watts, this oven will max out a 15 amp circuit (watts = volts * amps, so 1800W / 120V = 15A, discounting something called the power factor). You don't want to run anything else on the same line if your kitchen is on a 15A breaker. Modern kitchens are required to be on 20 amp breakers with 20 amp outlets by the electric code, and that's where you should probably be before using a high-power appliance like this one.<br /><br />In practice, it seems to be drawing closer to 13 amps, so you might still be able to get away with a dedicated 15 amp circuit.",2014-08-08

The Cuisinart was still a workhorse for me after 10 years use but I wanted a bigger one and it did not cook the underside of toast very well, the main reason I traded up. However the Breville doesn't toast the underside well either. It also has to go on the highest setting to get well browned toast and not too pale on the underside and takes 6 or 7 minutes to get there on the top browning setting. I normally toast two large slices at a time but with four it's not toasted to my satisfaction. I would expect at the top setting to at least have some black bits and be overcooked. I should be able to toast at half that setting, and then I suppose half the time. So it works great except for toasting.",2014-08-07

It has the look and feel of quality, is well engineered, and easy to use with dials rather than the typical digital punch screen that you have to memorize. The instructions are super clear and well written. Be aware that it is somewhat large, unlike a lot of toaster ovens from the past, but it fits on a standard counter top leaving about 9 inches of counter space in front. Also, be aware that you need to leave about 4\\"" of clear space on the sides and back for proper air circulation. The exterior does get a bit hot, but unlike a lot of toaster ovens, the door closes well. I suspect I won't be using my large oven much anymore.

Not due to health concerns, as the science clearly proves that microwave ovens are safe, but because Microwaves just don't cook good tasting food.<br /><br />Reheating in a Microwave can take a meal that my wife and I prepared for several hours and completley change the consistency, texture and taste of that meal.  We wanted something that will reheat food the natural way.  This is that answer.  Our leftovers now taste just as good as when we originally prepared them and the only trade-off is having to wait 15 minutes to eat instead of two minutes.  Entirely worth the wait!<br /><br />That being said, I'm a quite a bit disappointed in one aspect of this oven:  The controls.  The knobs are wobbly and horribly inaccurate.  I can turn the selection knob two clicks and it will rotate through 3-4 different options on the menu.  One click should equal one option.<br /><br />ALL of the control knobs are this way.  Not only that, but one of the control knobs tightens up horribly during part of it's rotation and then spins freely during the other half as if there's some kind of obstruction inside the casing that keeps getting caught.<br /><br />It's a nice oven,  it heats food very well and comes with lots of nice extras, but the controls are really cheap and don't leave me with a lot of confidence that this product will last several years.  I have a suspicious feeling that eventually one or more of these cheap cheap cheap controls knobs will stop functioning and leave me having to repair or replace this oven.",2014-07-30

It didn’t have to be full-size, as most of the time when I have two ovens going, the second one is used for things like a pie, a loaf of bread, baked potatoes and appetizers.  My trusty little Black and Decker Toaster Oven, which I love, and have had for years, just didn’t fit the bill – it’s just too small.<br />So far, this has Smart Oven been a great appliance – it took over my Black and Decker toasting jobs and has been super doing the traditional oven jobs.<br />It’s easy to figure out how to use it in spite of its complexity.  Wish more things were like that. The manual is clear and very detailed.<br />I’ve used the broil, bake, toast, bagel, and convection settings and they have all worked very well. The convection function is really good.  I’m getting crusty and brown, but not overly so, like I’ve had happen in a regular oven. The convection is also very quiet. A nice change from the traditional oven’s noisiness.<br />The one surprise I got was when I adjusted the broiling temperature.  It just goes in 100 degree increments – 500, 400, and 300 degrees.  The manual says that’s equivalent to high, medium and low, but I would like to see a more graduated approach.<br />I also love how the rack pulls out when you open the door (this is only true when the rack is in the middle position).<br />I feel my money was well spent.",2014-07-16

The pre-sets are very helpful and fairly easy to understand once you walk through them once. The ability to change time and temps for re-heating was definitely needed and I found other toaster ovens of this type wouldn't let you do that. The knobs are easy to turn, which wasn't the case for our last toaster oven - and the LED lit display makes it easy to know what you've selected and make adjustments if you want.<br /><br />My husband made cupcakes using this oven. It was his first time baking cupcakes and they came out perfectly fluffy and delicious. I compared many toaster ovens before making this purchase and I'm very happy that I did. The quality is second to none. The instruction book also has built-in grilling times (on broil) for sausages, beef, poultry and fish - which can also be adjusted and then saved in it's memory. The book also comes with recipes which include directions to make homemade pizza, roasted chicken breasts and even a 4 lb. beef rib roast. Since there's just two of us now, there's no need to use the big oven unless we're entertaining - so this is our &#34;go to&#34; oven for everything and it's doing it's job beautifully.",2014-07-15

They recommend you run the oven for 15 min before you use it.  This is to burn off anything on the heat elements and is simply done by setting the selector on pizza and letting it go.  Only I had to plug it in first.  This was a problem because my older home has few outlets in the kitchen.  I had a &#34;power strip&#34; sitting around so I plugged it into that.  I was very disappointed when the temp never got over 425 (set for 450).  OK, lets think about this.<br /><br />I was thinking over why the cord was so short.  I looked it over and its only #16 wire.  Hello!  this is 1800 watts!  I'll be 3foot is the longest cord they could get UL aproval on using #16 wire.  To make the cord longer, they would have to go to #14 wire, to get approved.  That's more then just a couple of pennies to upgrade the cord.  Then the head slap moment.  The power strip I was using- what wire was that?  I checked it out, it was 9 ft of #16 wire.  WAY to small for 1800 watts!<br /><br />I went up to ace and bought a high priced  6ft cord of #14 wire.  If I could have found one with #12, I would have bought that!  So I go back home and fire the oven up with the heavier cord.  Six and a half min after I hit on, bingo 450. and it stayed at exactly 450 for 15 min.  I would have expected the lighter cord to just get hot but not effect the temp, but this think is all electronic so who knows?<br /><br />First test- English muffin.  Set to toast and 2 slices and darkness 4.  Bam!  great English muffins, maybe just a touch dark for me so I tried another at the &#34;3&#34; setting and it was great.<br /><br />Next test, frozen pizza.  sorta like how I love sliders, well I also love these 9 inch frozen pizza that I can get for a buck.  (Often 10 for $10 and get an 11th free)  The brand in nation wide and begins with a &#34;T&#34;.  So I select frozen pizza and 10inch and let her go.  now the oven says twenty min.  And I know that too long so I watch and at 10 min I pull it out.  its great but would have been a crispy critter if I had left it in.<br /><br />Next was frozen fried fish and frozen french fries.  I just took the recommendation off the box (450 for 17 min) and let her go.  perfect! and all were cooked the same no matter where on the cookie sheet.  The next day I did the same with frozen fried fish and frozen hash browns,  Again I went by the fish box and they were perfect!  I tried some cup cake mix and again came up great setting according to the box.  I cooked a small roast according to a published recipe, and it to was perfect.<br /><br />In fact I have tried a number of different things, and all came out perfect using the instructions on the box.  While I'm enjoying the food, there is slight problem... this is suppose to have a slightly SHORTER cooking time (and yes I checked the fan is working)<br /><br />Frankly, I don't care. the food is evenly cooked and coming out cooked right using the published times and temps. I should mention this is the first I have used any electric oven, in the past I always used gas and never got the consistent results I'm getting with this.<br /><br />SO if you were my friend, and asked what you should buy, this is where I would point you.(Often 10 for $10 and get an 11th free)  The brand in nation wide and begins with a &#34;T&#34;.

Too bad, we really liked this oven. too.<br /><br />*** August 2014 Update ***<br />I tried contacting a different Breville customer service rep a day later and was offered a refurbished model with 6-month warranty for free, as long as I shipped back the defective one at their expense. If you don't get a satisfactory response, sometimes it pays to speak to someone else. Unfortunately for me, a few days later Bed Bath & Beyond saw my review on their website and offered a new replacement as well, but I had already shipped mine back to Breville. Kudos to both Breville and Bed Bath and Beyond for their awesome customer service. I hope the replacement will last for a reasonable time and will keep this review updated should something change.<br /><br />*** December 2015 Update ***<br />The refurbished replacement just died today, a little over a year old, and no longer heats up.

I had a Krups for years, and I loved it. I knew it was getting to the point that I needed to replace it, but having read the reviews for replacing it with the same model, the reviews weren't all that good. Hmmm....bummer. So one night, I'm watching Late Night with Jimmy Fallon (love him!) and he had a female chef on the show doing appetizers. She was using a toaster oven, so I paused it when they showed the close-up shot and saw that it was exactly this model of Breville BOV800XL Smart Oven. I figured if it was good enough for her I'd check it out. The reviews were very good, so I ordered it. I'm SO happy with this item. It is the very best toaster oven I've ever owned, bar none. And it is smart! I love the settings for bagels, toast, reheat, everything!!! And once you choose the darkness setting you want, this little gem toasts your items consistently perfectly! Do not even hesitate purchasing this item. It is great!!!",2014-07-03
US,28458103,R19263JXV16HSI,B001L5TVGW,608011455,Breville BOV800XL Smart Oven 1800-Watt Convection Toaster Oven with Element IQ,Kitchen,2.0,11.0,12.0,N,Y,"Buyer Beware, Great Oven--While it works","I purchased this oven a little over two years ago.<br /><br />I used it quite frequently, probably 2-3 times per week during that time. In terms of its functioning, it's great, and honestly the many other reviews you are able to find on it are spot on it. It cooks the take and bake or frozen pizzas very well, it can bake a great chicken, piece of fish or etc. It does a really good toasting job on bread, bagels, English muffins and all of that. It's relatively easy to clean, and has a nice sleek look.<br /><br />One of the nicest things about it is if you're not feeding a big family it really can replace your traditional oven for just about anything you'd cook in it.<br /><br />Now on to why I'm giving this a 2 Star. I was making some oven baked sweet potato fries the other day, and in mid cook I heard the oven just shut off. I go to look at it and the digital display is completely blank and nonresponse. If you look into this with Breville support, you're told to unplug the oven and give it a few hours to cool down. Then try to turn it back on, and if that doesn't work try plugging it into a different outlet. Neither solution did anything for me whatsoever. So, the $250 oven is broken after a few days past two years.<br /><br />This oven has a one year warranty, which if you do your research is about typical for this type of kitchen appliance. I understand sometimes you get unlucky and things break, I'd chalk this up to bad luck and probably give the Breville 3 or 4 stars in spite of it breaking on me with the assumption that it's probably rare that this happens. But as I researched my problem online, I've found many, many reports (on Amazon and many other sites) that this oven fails a lot for many owners. Some in an as short as a few months and some in the first 1/2 years like for myself. That tells me this oven has reliability problems, as nicely designed as it is and as nice as it works, the price point is simply too high for this to be acceptable.<br /><br />There isn't much Breville will do for you if your oven breaks out of warranty, there are some reports of them offering to repair it (for $100+ which is almost 50% of the price of a brand new oven), or give you a discount on the purchase of a new oven. But honestly with something that has reliability problems, you're throwing good money after bad on this one.<br /><br />When I went away to college over 10 years ago I brought a cheap Black & Decker Toaster Oven, it probably cost less than $50 and my parents had owned it for like 5 years at that point. It didn't have the fancy features of the Breville, I mostly used it for toasting and heating up frozen food type items. It's not the same type of product as the Breville, but it was a workhorse, it was used every day when it was my family's toaster and used very often by me for many years after that. That oven was still working perfectly fine two years ago when I threw it away to start using my newly purchased Breville. While I can't speak to any specific alternative brand of toaster oven, I just know that a well made product of this type can last a long time--I suspect that B&D would still be going if I still owned it. The Breville is not that type of product. The Breville is a premium product, sold by a company that puts a lot of effort into making their devices pretty and marketing their devices as upscale, but at least with this oven they do not put a lot of effort into controlling the quality of their manufactured product.<br /><br />I don't know if this carries over to other Breville products, but I had been considering two other Breville appliances in recent months and to be honest I'm glad this happened when it did, as now I know I'll be looking for other brands of those types of appliances instead.<br /><br />As I said, I've done my research and this has happened to *lots* of owners of this product. I think you should seriously weigh this genuine reliability problem against the price of this oven and the fact that yes, while it works it's amazing, when you're making your purchase.es, while it works it's amazing, when you're making your purchase.",2014-07-03

It is simply amazing.  Really.  Until 19 months later when it burned out and caught on fire.  That wasn't so nice.  To let you know how much I loved it, I considered, really considered purchasing another one; but I need something that is going to last more than 19 months (19 months to the day, by the way).  I am trying out the Oster one now, which its reviews say last about five years.  I am so sorry to see this appliance go; but it costs are simply too high.  We used it three or four times a day, seven days a week; perhaps that is just too much use for it, I don't know.  So I gave it three stars, five because while it lasted, it was wonderful and subtract two stars for not lasting.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just bought it again.  After using my Oster, I decided the extra expense of this model was well worth it.  I have a nasty burn on one finger from the new oven.  So I gave it one more star because, after using the competition, I can see it is well worth its price; but not 5 because it did die dramatically.",2014-06-15

That one was also a convection toaster oven of similar size. The reason I was interested in this one was because my old model was a huge energy sucker. Yes, it may have saved me on higher gas bills from using the large oven, but it was so poorly insulated - it had gaps between the door and the main unit - intentionally. After doing a little research, lack of insulation and energy efficiency of toaster ovens seemed to be a big problem. None are energy star rated, and though they may save energy overall, they could be so much better. This model was the only one I could find that seemed to have superior insulation. Yes, it could be even better, but since it's better than any of the competition, we'll give it a pass (for now). So, I decided to take a chance and try it out, and I did a little test. My electric company shows me the detail of how much energy I use per hour, and I always could see a huge spike when I used my toaster oven. So, I ran the old one at 450 for 15 minutes on one day (from cold - no convect) and the new one at 450 for 15 minutes the next day under the same conditions, making note of the hour so I could check the energy usage. And I found that the energy usage of the Breville was nearly half that of the B&D unit! Taking into account how much I use my toaster oven (usually at least once per day), I calculated that I should save around $10 a month. So, I could pay off the cost of the new one in a couple years with the savings. Not a crazy huge difference, but enough that it's worth considering when you're buying one for the first time, though it may not be worth switching, depending on your usage. But I'm a happy customer.<br /><br />Aside from the energy cost savings, the Breville has been a great oven so far. The coated pans it comes with are much nicer than any other toaster oven I've had, and I like the shape of the interior that's more squared off to fit various foods better. And the lighted display is sooooo much better than the B&D model. I can actually see what I'm selecting, and the display turns orange while it's cooking, which is a plus. It has various quick settings that seem pretty standard, like pizza, cookies, and reheat (which is new for me). I do kind of miss the baked potato setting my B&D had. That thing made a perfect baked potato every time. Another thing I like about the Breville is that the convect setting is standard on most functions, which is a great energy saver when people like my husband use the machine and don't bother to press the convect button - it's done for him already! (though he'll have to learn to adjust the time, lol).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase.

The door spring broke this week.  I reached out to Breville for options.  I really wanted to buy a replacement spring.  They wouldn't sell it to me.  They offered me $119 to send it in to be fixed or 30% off a new one.  I was almost ready to pluck down and buy a new one as I love this oven.  I can't believe after 5 years they still make the very same model. I would have hoped in some ways that they had a newer model.  I know I'm lucky to have had it last 5 years but I know that others have had theirs die after 2 or 3 years.<br /><br />What I like about this oven:<br />- Size cooks just about anything so very convenient<br />- Heats up fast<br />- Convection is a nice feature<br />- Good quality material that lasts and looks new if you keep it clean (except for the knobs)<br />- Cleaning tray is easy to pull out and clean and catches everything<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Price - well you get what you pay for<br />- Control knobs look good and like quality till you touch them and then they feel a bit cheap<br />- LCD display was high tech looking 5 years ago....now starting to look a bit dated...should be touch screen<br /><br />If your spring breaks I advice anyone that is the DIY type to open it up and fix that spring.  Put some new hooks on the spring and stretch it out just a bit if needed.  If you google it you can find out about replacement spring also.  Mainly the recommendation is a 3/8\\"" x 4\\"" x .035 WG spring.",2014-06-09

And finally we decided to replace it and the toaster (much counter space) with a good quality toaster/convection oven.<br /><br />This is the BEST decision we have made in a long time. The Breville juicer we bought last December has proven to be a work horse and a solid well built and functional necessity in our kitchen. So we began doing the research on toaster ovens and to no ones shock, Breville came up highest on consumer reports, google and Amazon reviews.<br /><br />I read dozens of reviews and test results. They screamed high quality, so we bought it.<br /><br />We LOVE THIS TOASTER OVEN!<br />Even our impatient and constantly-starving-as-if-we-never-feed-him 12 year old son LOVES using this little oven. Anything you could radiate with toxic waves can also be cooked in this thing and, with little effort to adjust your attitude towards speed of heating, it is even better.<br /><br />We use it daily and we will be happy to come back here in a year and update this review just to be fair. But if you are on the fence, BUY THIS ONE.<br /><br />In a day when nearly every appliance is made of flimsy plastic and paint, this oven (and for that matter, the juicer we have) is solid solid solid. The products feel like sturdy well built and well designed appliances. Designed in Australia and assembled in China under what must be seriously strict quality control, I am sold on this company.<br /><br />I wish Breviile would build a car.",2014-05-28

Some issues with dimensions of pans you may wish to know about...,"This is my review of Breville BOV800XL Smart Oven 1800-Watt Convection Toaster Oven with Element IQ. I review this product with reference to other items available for purchase on Amazon.com. I want to tell potential buyers about my discovery  to save time and frustration for somebody else.<br />First of all, I have two of these ovens installed on a rolling shelf on my back porch. Both ovens have functioned very well and I use at least one almost daily. Rarely I use two ovens at once; I had an electrician wire dedicated outlets on my porch so no blown fuses occur if I use more than one oven at the same time. I live in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas and we run air conditioning 360 days of the year most years so I try to cook outside.  I highly recommend the ovens. Most of my use is of the broiler function which I dearly love, then baking. I rarely toast, but I have done so and toasting is quite nice too.<br />Please be aware that Amazon.com does not give correct dimensions on three items I purchased to specifically use in the Breville Convection Toaster Oven. I hope my efforts to inform you of my problems will save time and energy for somebody else.  More than that, I hope Amazon.com will consider giving actual dimensions of their products. All three items listed as having a maximum of 12 inch dimension had instead 13.25  inch maximum total dimensions and as a result  when I put them into the oven I could not close the door. All pans are too large front to back. Part of the problem is that the actual dimensions are rectangular and square  dimensions, not circular dimensions. I cannot use these items said to be 12 x 12 inches. The  4.5 x 12 inch product can be used on its long axis  in this oven, but that is not the axis I was hoping to use (I foresee potential burn danger in putting in two loaf pans on that axis.).<br />I double checked the interior of the BOV800XL and I see that the 13 inch pizza said to be able to fit inside the oven has a middle &#34;cut out&#34; portion built into the back of the oven.  I thought a 12 x 12 pan would fit and allow me to close the door of the oven. I doubt that is the case. The square pan shipped with the oven is 11.5 x 11.5 inches. I cannot say for sure, but I doubt a 12 x 12 inch pan would fit and allow closing of the oven door. I urge you to keep this in mind.<br />I hope these comments are helpful.<br /><br />Incidentally, the three items I ordered were:<br /><br />Ateco 3-Inch Professional Square Baking Pan<br /><br />Fat Daddio's Anodized Aluminum Square Cake Pans (12 x 12 x 2 inch)<br /><br />Wilton Recipe Right Loaf Pan (Long 2-piece).ortion built into the back of the oven.

It is energy efficient and the perfect oven to use in an air conditioned kitchen because it doesn't cause the room to heat up like a regular oven.",2014-05-12

Does everthing it's advertised to do and more.,"I love Breville products.  It started with a juicer, then a bread machine.  I'm now looking into one of their high end esspresso machines.  After reading reviews and checking out youtube videos, I decided to go all out and get this expensive toaster.  So far I've done many pizzas, both fresh and frozen.  All turned out perfectly.  Cookies, cinnamon rolls, biscuits, pies, cake donuts and cheescakes come out great.  Toast (well it's a toaster oven at heart) comes out perfect.  And the fact that you can toast 1 to 6 slices of bread at the same time and have them all come out evenly toasted is impressive.  My family loves toast in the morning, and this Breville Smart Oven makes it so easy.<br /><br />I've recently ventured into coffee roasting and was debating on buying an expensive coffee roaster, but after trying a coffee roast in the Breville Smart oven with great results, I think I'll just stick with the Breville for now.  It's even heating throughout the baking chamber roasted the beans very evenly.  If you're into coffee roasting, you'll know there are machines that run into thousands of dollars that simply apply heat evenly to the coffee beans being roasted.  Breville's roast setting with the convection fan on seems to do the job just fine.  Timing and temperature control is crucial to coffee roasting, and Breville's variable heating elements keep the temperature where you set it.  Since I'm new to coffee roasting, I may be doing it wrong based on popular opinion, but the results speak for themselves.  Here are some picures I took of this coffee roast: [...]  ***Note: if you're going to try this, do it outside as coffee roasting generates a decent amout of smoke.<br /><br />So aside from it being a great little oven, I am a little skeptical about how long the \\""computerized controls\\"" wll last.  What happens when the selection controls wear out or the computer chips malfunction and you can't select/modify settings or start the oven.  I'm hoping Breville has tested this and expects their products to have many years of life.  As that does worry me a bit, I hear great things about Breville's customer support so that offsets my worries.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an awesome little oven that appears to handle more than Breville advertises.  I'm extremely satisfied!  Thanks Breville for the great products!  I'd recommend this oven to anyone who'd like to use their large home oven more, but doesn't because pre-heating takes too long and they're making smaller portions.this and expects their products to have many years of life.

I was very happy with it, and with all its many functions.  I told all my friends how terrific it was.  But shortly after the warranty expired (of course!), the LED display went dark, rendering the oven useless.  You can't choose a function and a temperature and a time if you can't see the choices.  So I called Breville and explained the problem.  I also told them I knew we were out of warranty, but I was hoping there was something we could do to get the unit repaired.  After some discussion, they agreed to replace the oven.  At the time I was told that the replacement was a refurb, but now I'm told it was new.  In either case I thought that was great, and I told all my friends what terrific customer service they had.<br /><br />A few days ago, after we'd had the replacement for about nine months, the display malfunctioned again.  This time the dial that controls the number of minutes could only get the display to toggle between two numbers.  So I guess it's more accurate to say that the dial malfunctioned, and the display showed the results of that malfunction.  I called Breville again and explained the new problem, asking if there was a troubleshoot for that.  I was told to unplug the oven for a couple of days and then plug it into a different outlet, a reset that solved most such issues.  So I did, and it didn't--solve the issue, that is.  I recontacted Breville and was told that they could repair it for me, for the mere cost of $119.  Aside from that, there was nothing else they could do.  Or would do.  I told the rep that for a few more dollars I could buy an entirely new oven, rather than throw $400 at one with a now-proven record of failing.<br /><br />The reason I spent almost $300 on a toaster oven in the first place was to get a good appliance with some real longevity to it.  If I'd wanted something I knew I'd be throwing into the landfill in three years, I'd have bought another of the $25 pieces of junk I'd been tossing out before I bought the Breville.  So now I'm tossing a $300 piece of junk into the landfill.  I don't see that as a win for anyone.  Except maybe Breville, in the short term.I'd have bought another of the $25 pieces of junk I'd been tossing out before I bought the Breville.

The reason I hesitated so long?  Twofold - the price and disbelief that it could really be as great as most people seemed to think.  So an extra year of heating up that big wall oven to cook something small.  An extra year of it taking forever for the big wall oven to preheat and then have the fan running later to cool it down.  A year of not being able to bake just TWO cookies!<br /><br />Actually, my old toaster oven would have baked just two cookies if I had trusted it enough to let the temperature get up to 350 degrees.  But, ten year old toaster ovens aren't always the most reliable appliances so I never ever used it for anything but toasting bread.  Now?  Well, now I'm cooking all kinds of things in this smart-box and loving every minute I'm using it.  Seriously, this thing would be 5+ stars if it only had an interior light!  Why is there no interior light?<br /><br />The oven has a large footprint so it takes up quite a bit of space on the counter.  Something to think about before you buy because it should also probably have its own electrical outlet if at all possible.  My electrician son-in-law assures me that the circuit I have mine plugged into is in no danger of overloading and I trust his superior knowledge.  I love how quickly the oven reaches temperature -- it might take three or four minutes to come up to 350 degrees, but that's it.  Done!  Be warned, though, the top of the oven does get hot while it is turned on.  Don't think you can store anything on top of the oven.  I have now been using the oven over two months and have cooked all kinds of things.  I've toasted breads of all different thicknesses and types to absolute perfection using the controls to specify degree of darkness.  I've cooked two frozen dinner rolls from appliance turn-on to turn-off in less than ten minutes.  I've cooked a 9x13 pan of chicken enchiladas in less than 25 minutes from start to finish.  I've cooked all sorts of frozen casseroles without having to heat up the wall oven.  And yesterday I baked a quiche in 47 minutes and it was perfect -- the crust wasn't even over-browned.<br /><br />I like the ease of moving the rack into three different positions.  I like having the rack extend out of the toaster when it is in the middle position so I don't have to reach in to get one piece of toast.  I actually use the convection feature on this oven all the time while I can't seem to get into the habit of doing that with my wall ovens.  I like the simplicity of the selection knobs; just turn the knob until you get to the feature, temperature or time you want, press 'start', and walk away.  The toaster oven has been very easy to keep clean, but I have to admit that I would not use it for something like baking a chicken because I'm thinking it would be very hard to clean something like that.  No, there are some jobs I will strictly leave to the wall ovens.<br /><br />That pretty much takes care of my cooking experiences with how much I like this oven.  As for addressing the issue of price, I can only say that I have definitely gotten what I paid for.  The oven does actually feel as if it is 'smart'.  I'm using less electricity regarding the power usage involved with wall oven units and also with the added power consumption needed to cool down the kitchen after using a large oven.  I know that this new product is built to be more efficient than the previous toaster oven I had.

The control panel is super easy to use (you almost don't need the user manual) and the performance is top-notch.  I love the stainless steel finish and the crumb tray that you can remove without opening the door.  I especially love the preheat option that signals when it has reached temperature.  My only caution is for those who have limited counter top space, as this is a large toaster oven, measuring 18.5 X 10 X 12.5 excluding the handle on the door.  It does, however, have the capacity to toast 6 slices of bread at once and can accommodate a 9&#34; X 13&#34; pan without handles and a 13&#34; pizza pan which is included.

It's very easy to use, the dials are quick and simple to set and each category remembers your previous settings. This toaster oven cooks very evenly. I've had no trouble getting desired results with a variety of items.<br /><br />There are some really nice touches in the design that shows you they really thought this oven out for usability and convenience. The wall plug has a ring which makes it both easy to push and and pull out of the socket. The display lights up red when the oven is on, and is blue when it's not. The display turns off 10 minutes after done cooking, which means you have an idea how long food may have been in there after it finished cooking in case you were busy. The magnets to pull out the rack is very helpful so you don't have to reach into the oven to get the pan out (only for the middle rack).<br /><br />My only accessory recommendation for this toaster oven is the Bamboo Cutting board (you can probably find it for the related products or &#34;what people buy frequently with this item&#34;). It's a wonderful accessory because it gives you a place to place things which is safe even when the oven is on.

The function, temperature, and time dials are easy for us to use, and the precision I can get on toast is really nice. I updated this review on 1/16/2015, as I'm about to roast a butternut squash in the thing. I do these things and keep wondering, 'why would I heat up all of the hair in a large oven, when I can get this thing quicker and with a timer that shuts off?'<br /><br />You know, I hope this works out for everyone who buys. For the reader who's read reviews about theirs dying after a year, I want to give you this. My wife and I really paused before buying after reading those reviews. But we bit the bullet and purchased in late 2012. It's now late 2016, and it's still working quite well.<br /><br />As for the other reviews, who knows? Maybe these things are easily done in by power surges - we don't get lots of thunderstorms. Maybe there's some quality variance from the manufacturer. Just, I want to tell the reader here that that's not my experience so far.<br /><br />Good luck to everyone.",2014-05-03

Really? Yes, Really! This oven is amazing. How many times have you tried to make frozen french fries, chicken strips, or some other frozen item, only to have it come out soggy and tasting like a wet sock? How many times have you burned your bagel on one side? What about frozen pizza burned on one side with a limp crust? Not with this Breville oven. Frozen food tastes like it was just made fresh. Fries are crispy on the outside and soft in the center. Bagels are toasted to perfection. Pizzas are cooked perfectly evenly. I don't know how it does it, but this oven is really amazing. My only complaint would be the knobs. They seem to be a little too sensitive, and need a light touch. Also, a light inside the oven would be a nice addition. Do yourself a favor and get this oven. You won't regret it.<br /><br />We got this oven to use instead of the large gas range in our kitchen. The gas range takes a while to heat up and heats up the whole house at the same time. It's brutal during the summer. This Breville still puts of some heat, but it is only a fraction compared to our full size gas range. Summer cooking is back on with the Breville.

Breville replaced the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ovens all of which failed with the same E05 code, three of them right out of the box and the last after 5 uses. Breville refuses to tell me what an E05 error is. I have never heard of such a strange reluctance. Usually a technician in any specialty can tell you what the code means and why it is happening. This is not the case with Breville. It seems that their view is that E05 means &#34;we will exchange your unit until the end of your original warranty period regardless how much use you get out of the ovens we send you&#34;. I would like them to tell me if there is something wrong with the circuits in my house that is causing the problem, but they won't. Just in case my electrical circuits were bad I replaced the circuit breaker in the main panel and the wall socket with one of the more expensive units with the better contacts. This did nothing. The voltage to the unit is OK as well. I am a loss to explain the problem and I now find that the Australian designers of the unit refuse to publicize what E05 means. The manual only states the E05 means send the unit back. This is absurd and I suggest that Amazon discontinue carrying the product, despite the numerous happy customers, until Breville is more open to its customers with continuous failures of their products.

The BOV800XL was Amazons highest rated oven. I also went to consumer reports and found that this is their &#34;Top Rated&#34; toaster oven! Amazon consumers and Consumers Reports cannot both be wrong so I made the purchase.<br />You can be sure that this is NOT a &#34;Toaster Oven&#34;! It is an oven that makes toast and warms pop tarts just fine. But, it is an &#34;Oven&#34; first!<br />I have been amazed at all of the settings available and the ease of operation especially when adjusting cook time and temparature.<br />This is a great oven. The size is big enough that I can use the oven to warm my larger coffe cups first thing in the morning using the lowest rack setting. I know; who warms their coffee cups? I do!<br />Buy this &#34;oven&#34; that also will make toast and you will not be disappointed. I promise!",2014-04-17

But it does everything we need and more. My wife and I bought this with our wedding money almost 2 years ago and we use it all the time. Our townhouse has a very bad oven and we wanted to get something that we could use to replace it. She was worried that it might be too small to truly replace the oven in functionality, but after we used it a couple of times she thought differently. We have made everything from cookies, baked chicken, fries, pizzas etc in this and everything always comes out perfectly. The big reason we like it so much is everything cooks evenly, there is usually no need to flip things or keep checking the bottom of certain foods. There is a lot of settings for types of foods you might want to cook and it is very easy to clean. I made bacon in it the other day and it came out perfectly crisp just like you would do on the stove. In fact we haven't needed to use our large oven for anything at all since we bought it.

I use it all the time. It heats up quicker than a full size oven and yet doesn't heat up the whole kitchen. It probably won't last as long as a full size oven, but it's a lot cheaper.<br /><br />BUT: to avoid getting burned when removing hot things from it, get a plaster or bondo mixing board to slide in under the items in the oven. This plus a hot pad or oven mitt will enable easy safe removal. See at Amazon their Dynatron 366 Mixing Board or Harbor Freight's aluminum mixing board # 98967, or check an auto parts, building supply or hardware store. I stumbled on the H/F board by accident, and believe me it is very helpful.<br /><br />Also, get at Amazon the Breville BOV800CB Bamboo Cutting Board that fits nicely on top of the oven. It enables you to put things on top of the oven without concerns about the heat. I can't speak for its quality as a cutting board though.",2014-03-25

Several years ago we purchased a cheaper toaster oven that was about half the price, and it still works great at an apartment we rent, but for our primary residence we wanted something a little nicer. The Breville looks great and works great. Concerned with adding one more gadget in the kitchen, we tried the toast option on the Breville and were so happy with the results, we tossed the old toaster to make more room for the Breville toaster oven. It also works great as a pizza oven. It is so easy to use that my husband is willing to use it, and he never wants to use cooking gadgets. Five thumbs up at our house for the Breville.",2014-03-23

We have used and owned a variety of units so I do feel as though I am somewhat of an authority when it comes to this type of product.<br /><br />One of the biggest complaints I hear about &#34;toaster&#34; ovens is that they can't make toast. Well, this unit does a great job on toast and just about anything else.<br /><br />The best feature is probably the most confusing for new owners. There are so many options, how do you know what to pick. Well, I have to say this is the most confusing aspect of the oven, but in time, you will appreciate these options. I know the pizza was difficult. We had to reduce the size of the pizza to get it to cook correctly, but now we know which setting works best, it remembers and selects it each time.<br /><br />The oven is also very easy to clean. Our last unit (Cuisinart) you had to turn the unit around to remove the tray.  This one is right up front and makes it very easy.<br /><br />On the inside of the oven, there are three slots for the grate telling you which level works best for what you are cooking. It suggests you put the broil items at the top. I personally like keeping broil items on the middle because the top is too close. I do have to cook items longer than their suggested 2 to 3 minutes, but I would rather do that then have it that close.<br /><br />We rarely use our oven anymore which is nice in the summer when we are trying to keep the house cool.  And, let's talk about aesthetics. The oven is gorgeous. It looks nice sitting in your kitchen. If you have a beautifully designed kitchen with stainless steel stove, fridge, dishwasher, etc... then this will fit in nicely.<br /><br />If you enjoy using a toaster oven for your every day needs, the Breville BOV800XL will not disappoint.  This is a toaster, oven, convection, and an easy to use reheat device that will help you with your cooking needs.",2014-03-19

And Breville are very cleverly targeting their ads at PBS cooking show watchers.  I kept seeing the ad for this one before Ming and Lidia.  I was sorely tempted.  Then our oven gave out.  Sorry, but what kind of manufacturer builds ovens by sticking the glass door on with liquid nails??  So until we move somewhere where we can fit a fabulous Five Star cooker in the kitchen, we're putting up with the cooker, via duct tape on the door.  Rings are fine, but we're too scared to risk the oven, which was all the reason I needed to plump down my cash for the Breville.  There are three sizes, and we got the biggest one.  It is unbelievably fast and very efficient.  Don't let the cats jump on the top though as it gets very hot and you don't want burnt paw smell ruining your mac & cheese.  The various settings are very handy.  Pizza comes out perfect.  Toast is great, although I have yet to figure out how dark I like my toast - do I want to see my marmite or do I just want to assume I've remembered to put some on.  I digress.

The unit beeped several times then displayed E02, the manual described the error as non-resetable fault so I called Breville's support. They asked if the unit had been unplugged for 20 minutes, I said yes it came out of the box. They asked for me to plug it in on an outlet outside of the kitchen, but I really wanted this oven to work in the kitchen. After 20 minutes of it being unplugged I plugged it in in the living room but fortunately had the same error. I was relieved actually, who would want an oven in the living rooms?

So far I've used it for: baking (pastry and conventional food), roasting, toasting, bagels, warming and reheating, and broiling.  It's handled everything I've thrown at it.  The controls are easy to use and make sense, and the manual does a good job of giving you an in depth understanding of all the ways you can utilize the oven.  Being able to leave plates on top of the oven (warming area) is really nice and a convenient way to avoid hot food being placed on cold plates, never good.  The 3 rack positions work really well for the varying functions.  I particularly like the fan for convection baking purposes.  It's nice to be able to get a hard working toaster oven to get those high temps so I don't have to use my gas oven and feel like I'm wasting resources if I'm just heating up something small.  If you're in the market, I don't think you can go wrong with this model; particularly if you are up for a wide range of uses.

Same way with the GE Microwave which I will review later.  Kids just do awful things to these convenient appliances.  Anyway I asked a lot of questions, did a lot of research and went through a lot of product reviews.  I came up with this Breville Convection Toaster Oven.  I was a little antsy waiting on it because you know sometimes things look different at home than they do on a web page.  Well there was no need for that because I have been playing with this thing since last night and have found NOTHING that it doesn't do well. Convection cooking is new to me (was a little worried about that) but I'm getting the hang of it and I like it.  It looks great in my somewhat smallish kitchen (another of my worries).  It's pretty and it does everything.  I could cook a whole dinner in it.  Now I'm just trying to figure out how soon I can spring it on my husband, now that the kids are gone, that I want to knock that old wall oven out and get a whole new kitchen.

I will say, after reading a few negative reviews as well as looking at the price tag(about double what I paid for Kitchen-Aid), I was a little hesitant.  However, knowing I could return it if I didn't like it, made the decision easier.  First of all, I do have a Breville Bread machine so I was fairly familiar with the quality of construction of this brand.  In addition, I am usually the type of person that would rather spend money to get a great item that will last many years vs getting a piece of crap every year or so.  I like to get something and know I will be good to go on that item for many years.. I feel that way with this item.. Although I have only had it about 4 days, everything I have cooked has been perfect.. Perfectly brown, perfectly done, etc. It does a great job of evenly heating the oven.  I also love the convection part as well. I don't have a convection oven but always wanted one.. Now I do.. Baking cookies, biscuits, etc., will be great!.  All I can say is if you want a toaster oven(which this is really way more than just that) and don't mind the extra 100 or so dollars, this is your item.  I would say if you don't want to spend this much, you might look at the Breville models just below this..

I was planning to use it for heating prepared meals and for toasting.  I must say now that calling this appliance a toaster oven is a vast understatement!  I do a lot of cooking and have yet to find any type of food that it doesn't prepare perfectly!<br /><br />  Broiling: fish, steak, chicken, chops, flatiron steak, skirt steak, etc.<br />  Baking: chicken<br />  Roasting: prime rib, rack of lamb, pork tenderloin, breast of veal, etc. (you must have butcher remove bone from rib roast--it's a<br />  tight fit)<br /><br />It does such a good job with everything that I have yet to use my Jenn-Air stove (why heat the kitchen for one person).  Did I say that it toasts a perfect bagel?  Learning curve is very short--I've never read the instruction manual.  I only read the quick start guide.  It cleans easily: I just use a damp rag and paper towels (make sure you unplug first), the only blemishes are some yellowing along the top of the door and along the leading edge of the top--probably from the heat generated from frequent broiling.  I don't consider this unreasonable after several years of almost daily use.  It still works as well as it did the first day, but if it ever needs replacement, I'll keep my fingers crossed that they still manufacture this model!

It worked great for the first year, and we were very pleased with it.  Then after 14 months, it suddenly died without warning and stopped working completely.<br /><br />So I contacted Breville customer support, and explained my problem.  Although It was outside of the 1-year warranty, Breville was kind enough to send me another brand new one at no cost. This was sent to me April 2, 2012. Way to go Breville!<br /><br />Now fast forward about 2 years later to Feb. 27, 2014. I've noticed in the last 6 months, my new replacement oven has started acting erratically, and we now have to press the button several times to get it to come on. It will come on eventually, but only after repeatedly pressing it, sometimes several times, which is very frustrating.<br /><br />So once again I called Breville customer support, and I explained my situation to Melanie, the customer support rep.<br /><br />She acknowledged sending me a replacement oven April 2012, but reminded me that my oven is outside of the warranty, and she would not be able to send me another replacement. Melanie offered me a 25% discount on a new oven, which I told her was unacceptable to me.<br /><br />To say the least, I'm very disappointed with Breville, and the obvious lack of durability of these ovens. I've now had 2 of these ovens fail within 3 years, so there is obviously some sort of problem with them, esp. since I only use the oven a a few times per week.<br /><br />Offering a 25% discount on another $300 oven that will probably last only a year or two is just not a good use of my money. Heck, my last Blank & Decker toaster oven I had before Breville cost me about $40 and lasted 15 years! Why can't Breville make an oven that last even half that long?<br /><br />I certainly won't be buying another one.<br /><br />To read more about this continuing problem of defective Breville ovens, read the posts on this thread here:<br /><br />[..]that last even half that long?<br /><br />I certainly won't be buying another one.<br /><br />To read more about this continuing problem of defective Breville ovens, read the posts on this thread here:<br /><br />[..]",2014-02-27

The first one arrived with defective accessories. The enamel coating on the accessories was flaking off. The bag was full of the flakes. My experience is to return the product even if I find the slightest defect because who knows what else might be wrong and I don't want to risk more problems showing up later. So i returned the product and Amazon immediately shipped me another BOV800XL. This arrived with no visible defect. But after using it only once to reheat a pizza I noticed the LEDs in the display started to burn out. The display became unreadable. So I returned the oven again. I wondered if I should start looking for another toaster oven from a different manufacturer. I considered the Kenmore Elite Infrared Convection oven. But I really liked the interface and design of the Breville products. So I decided to give Breville another opportunity to make it right. I am waiting for my third BOV800XL. Stay tuned for more updates after i receive my new product.<br /><br />January 31, 2015 UPDATE<br /><br />I am still using my Breville oven and I am very happy with it.

It worked perfectly until one day, out of the blue, it suddenly died--no display, no power--completely dead. We researched Breville's service options and found their system sorely lacking.

He found the problem was a simple, inexpensive thermal fuse (SF214E) located inside the unit in the incoming power wire. Other reviewers claimed these fuses were difficult to find. We found a 3-pack readily available on eBay for $4. The fuse is relatively simple to replace, but the oven itself is quite difficult to take apart and reassemble because of the large number of small screws and the complexity of the assembly.<br /><br />We surmise that the fuse originally blew after we ran the oven for an hour at 400 degrees, then immediately used it to toast some cheese melts without giving it time to cool down.

SUPERB!!,"[[VIDEOID:59a4e03804a3616a6985892fd676bdd0]] I decided to wait a bit before doing a review, and I really wish people would wait at least a few months before reviewing any appliance or electronic device, for that matter, simply because most things are going to work well 2 or 3 days after you've just purchased them. I get enthused myself, and can understand the temptation, but give it a good test drive first please!<br /><br />Anyway, I've had my Breville Smart Oven for at least six months, used it almost everyday, and it works beautifully! I have noticed some of the negative reviews, and decided to be easy on the Smart Oven. In other words, it is pretty light and can be jarred out of place and bumped about pretty easily, so just in case it is a bit delicate, I treat it fairly gently. But, perhaps I'm being overly cautious.<br />Also, I just realized recently that I use the 'convection' function way more than I really need to, besides, perhaps some things might turn out better if you use the longer, old-fashioned way once in awhile, that way there's less wear and tear on it too.<br /><br />I've broiled, roasted and toasted almost everything I can think of, and everything turns out great! I haven't baked anything, not being much into sweets, though I wouldn't mind trying to bake something like banana bread someday. I was also surprised recently to find that when warming up left-over pizza, I just stick it on the middle rack for 3 or 4 minutes on 'broil' at 500 degrees (instead of the warming function), and it turns out great! Far better than using a microwave oven to warm stuff like that up! Speaking of 'warming', I love using the top of the oven to keep things warm on the plate, while I'm preparing something else.<br /><br />I've made various roasts, fish, french fries, chicken, burgers, bacon, toast and on and on and on.... Also, frozen food comes out great as well.<br /><br />Aside from all that, one of my favourite things about this is having an oven right there at waist height, or higher, instead of having to bend over, crouch, or what have you, trying to negotiate and wrangle something out of a regular oven, not to mention occasionally burning a hand, finger or forearm. It's impressive how many different things will fit in the Smart Oven, except, of course, a turkey. For that, I have one of those big, plug-in roasting pans that I only use once every year or two. Actually, the main reason I bought the Breville Smart Oven was because the ancient stove in my apartment had pretty much bitten the dust.<br /><br />Before getting this, I had a Breville Smart Grill, but returned it because the top grill wouldn't stay in place, coming loose. In all fairness, I realized later that perhaps that may have been my fault for not having been particularly careful inserting or releasing the grills flat, and in an upright position. In other words, I will eventually get another Breville Smart Grill, because the thing was incredible! The way it grilled, the flavour, plus the most 'non stick' coating I've ever experienced!<br /><br />Like another Breville review I posted about one of their best espresso machines, I really love Breville products- at least the 'high-end' ones! A little pricey, but I've used my espresso machine almost every single day for over six years, and NEVER a problem! With regards to the Smart Oven, at around $200 or less (when on sale), even if it broke down after 3 years.......

Then I noticed the door did not close like it should , it had a gap on right side. I called Breville service and they asked for pictures of gap then said they would replace it with a new one. The 2nd one arrived and I plugged it in per instructions to pizza setting and it started pre heating , then after a few mins it quit and displayed an error message that it was over heating. The instructions said if it continues to display the error message  to call service. I tried it once more and it went completely dead.  I called service again and was told to return it for a new one. The 3rd oven was delivered and it works like it should and very happy with it. For the rather high cost of the oven I think it should have been right the first time. I replaced a 10 year old Cuisinart toasted oven that still works fine but the Breville has more features that I wanted and it's larger.  I gave it 3 stars for the hassle of shipping two back (pre paid) and waiting for replacements... however if the first one worked like the 3rd one does then I would have given it 5 stars.",2014-02-11

Did I really need another appliance on my countertop?  How often do I really need a second oven or make toast?  As Thanksgiving approached and the need for a second oven became more urgent, I sprang for the Breville as a Christmas present to myself.<br /><br />What a brilliant product this is.  Not only does it cook better and more evenly than a full-sized oven, it is extremely easy to use, and is terrifically efficient.  It heats up within a minute or two, and shuts off when the timer is done - eliminating the risk of overcooking.  I use it as my main oven now for a full range of needs: baking, broiling, roasting, and yes, toast, which it makes to perfection.  I find the cooking options to be very intelligent, knobs are easy to calibrate when the cooking is underway, and the accessories that come with the oven well-made and suitable to almost all of my needs.  In addition, most of my baking ware fit easily into the oven, including some of my medium heat-proof skillets.<br /><br />I've decided this is the best single appliance I've added to my kitchen in years and highly recommend it.  It is well worth the money I paid for it - this is not simply a toaster oven, it's become a kitchen workhorse that's a joy to use.",2014-02-08

It can take my LeCreuset tatin pan and look good doing it. I also use Chicago Metallic nonstick baking pans, and got the Breville pizza pans to deal with 13&#34; frozen pizza. However, it doesn't stop there. I love the way it does a bagel, or a baked omelette, or frozen fries. It is definitely SMART, and it is easily adjusted with the three dials and the push-button on/off. Once you press the ON button, on many functions it does a brief preheat--probably the quickest operation for any countertop oven I've ever owned. After the preheat, with the sounding of the alarm, it begins the countdown of the function selected. I really love the simplicity of adjusting the temp and the time, both up and down without cancelling any setting, just twirling the two larger dials left or right. The surfaces of the oven are hot to the touch, except for the door handle, and the dials,which remain cool the whole time. After the cooking phase is over, you can scroll to KEEP WARM, and it will maintain 160F for an hour--which is also adjustable if need be.  The shelf slides out easily, which makes removing hot dishes safe, with few spills to clean up.<br /><br />I had a slightly larger microwave/convection oven with a turntable, sitting beside my new Breville oven. Somehow the space between the two ovens was compromised and I heard this faint ting/ting/ting/ting sound coming from the Breville. Oops. It is serious about keeping a clear space of 4 inches for ventilation, so do not think you can jam it against another object. It vents on both sides. That other oven (a Sharp) took over three times as long to preheat as the Breville, even though the interior space was comparable. When our kitchen remodel is done, this oven will be on an open shelf over my largest work space,  7' x 3', where it will be easily accessible and quite safely secured.  I really do not like anything sitting on my counters.<br /><br />This oven has brought back a sense of joy to my time in the kitchen. It is fun to &#34;play&#34; with a Smart Oven! My new oven makes it easy to try new recipes. It also LOOKS PRETTY, and doesn't need to be hidden away like most grungy toaster ovens....this one is SO MUCH MORE than that.  When hot weather arrives, a small oven with a quick preheat will be less demanding on the air conditioner. Your mileage may vary, but this is MY favorite thing for meal preparation.rought back a sense of joy to my time in the kitchen. It is fun to &#34;play&#34; with a Smart Oven!

I'm anti-microwave, so this is my quick way to heat up left-overs....I can spread pasta salad on the metal pan, sprinkle with some shredded cheese, and that's headed in 10 min. with browned edges like It's been baking for hours.....I'm baking my first brownie batch right now, and they look great....I could go on and on about this miracle oven and I've only had it for 1 week....God bless you Breville, I love every single one of your products!!!  Also, for others to take note, this is the largest and most expensive of the 3 Breville toaster oven models and has the highest reviews...if you are more of a culinary guru, I'd get this one....the smallest, cheapest one had some issues people mentioned like cooking unevenly and appeared to be more for dorm room use or students who aren't total foodies....",2014-01-30

I hate what microwaves do to food.  We (couple) recently got stationed in Korea and our oven was atrocious.  It couldn't hit or keep a temperature to save it's life and it was terribly uneven.  I took a chance on this hoping it would let us avoid the oven most of the time.  It sure has.  Everything about this oven makes it a sure thing to replace a bigger unit for a couple's amount of cooking.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) LCD:  I really thought this was overkill until I started using it.  It's exceptionally nice for what you'd expect on a toaster oven and it's actually somewhat necessary with all the settings.<br />2) Crumb tray:  The tray is pretty heavy duty, pulls out the front, and cleans incredibly easy.  We kept up with it at first, but after being lazy a few times it still cleans up really well.<br />3) Magnetized tray:  When you open the door the tray comes partially out with it.  It's simple.  It works.<br />4) Evenness:  With the convection fan it actually does heat very evenly despite being so close to the elements.  This absolutely saved baking here.  The big oven destroyed any pie, etc., but they come out great in here (just one at a time :( )<br />5) Pizza:  We have to make our own pizzas here and they come out great in this thing.<br />6) Tots: Throw em on the broil pan and they come out cooked perfectly, even on all sides.  Extrapolate this to nearly anything that's troublesome to cook on all sides.<br /><br />We've got a pyrex pan that fits in there just a bit crooked.  If the meal fits in that, it goes in this.<br /><br />Cons:<br />You're likely going to have to go out and get proper cookware that can fit in this thing.  You'll stop using your oven.",2014-01-29

It's actually faster for me to order pizza delivery than it is to make a frozen one myself, which is crazy.  Well not any more!  This thing preheats in minutes!

After 1 year + of steady use I can say this unit does a pretty great job all around.<br />Unlike a lot of &#34;toaster ovens&#34; this regulates temperature by &#34;pulsing&#34; current to up to 5 heating elements depending on the settings: result is very consistent temperature. Which means I don't need to fire up our (very nice but large)  oven to cook a seafood casserole, chicken parmigiana, cauliflower gratin etc The door has a pair of magnets which draw the rack in middle position gracefully forward when opened; easy to baste, check, done-ness etc. of whatever you have in there.<br />It's display changes color  and it beeps when it has heated to your set temperature, Also beeps when finished. Minimum temperature setting is 120 F, great for &#34;keep warm&#34;.<br /><br />Some minor points to consider. I'll try not to get too technical.<br />The pulsed current and high wattage (1800 watts max) means that you want to give this oven it's own circuit, OR make it the only thing running on that circuit while using it. Any lights on the same &#34;leg&#34; of your electrical service will do some &#34;bouncing&#34; right along with the oven's pulsing. I wish Breville sold a 240 volt model in the US market. Minor inconvenience...<br /><br />Put some foil onto the crumb tray, change as needed. The &#34;non-stick&#34; coating will not survive repeated attempts to remove baked on grease, I speak from experience....<br /><br />Many people would like a lighted interior for a toaster oven that's used for baking (including me). But because Breville put five heating elements in this unit, it works great but leaves little room for a light. A tubular quartz lamp with a shield might be fit in somewhere; that would add to the cost but might be nice.....<br /><br />Overall I'm very satisfied with this unit.

It works well and cooks even.  The magnetic tray works well.  The presets are useful if not necessary.  But for the high price i was expecting better.  After it isn't used for a while it goes to a kind of Sleep mode that takes a few seconds to wake up from.  So when you turn the selector knob or even just hit the start button, all it does it light up the display.  Nothing happens.  It's an annoying quark for such an expensive product.  Also, the knobs don't all turn smoothly.<br /><br />I have also noticed when I am making toast a considerable amount of steam comes out between the door and the display causing the display to fog up.  I am worried this will cause long term damage.<br /><br />So though this is a great product, it is overpriced for the quality and I am concerned with how long it will last...",2014-01-22

Aside from the that, the oven functions perfectly in every other way.  With a one year warranty, I'm well over the threshold, but with an appliance in this price range I still kind of feel, well, *screwed* if you know what I mean.  This unit replaced a $19.99 Black and Decker that was 20 years old, and aside from not toasting evenly due to heating elements that sort of grew over time, was still going strong.  I will contact both Breville and Amazon in the event that anything can be done at this point, and if so, will update my review.<br /><br />When this oven works, it is flawless.  Great features that are very well thought out.  Perfect capacity.<br /><br />**Update**<br />After contacting Breville, they generously offered a one-time replacement of my defective unit with a remanufactured unit.  The new unit has some slight differences from the original, so I'm hoping that whatever caused my original oven to fail has since been updated also.  Kudos and my gratitude to Breville!",2014-01-22

I'll quickly describe my scenario so you know where I'm coming from.<br /><br />Where I'm coming from:<br />~ I have a Gemini double-oven range that I really like.  The top oven is quite small and is great - we only use the bigger bottom oven to do a turkey.<br />~The small oven is nice but I found I was using my toaster oven quite a bit to make things for our toddler as it heated up faster than even my small oven and was safe for her - she couldn't pull it open when it was hot!<br />~ I had a CHEAP, small toaster oven that I found to be pretty satisfactory but it was aging and I did worry a bit about safety.  Plus it looked horrible.<br /><br />What I like about the Breville:<br />~ It does pretty much everything - toast is good (no better or worse than toaster so the real plus is that it gets an appliance off the countertop), baking is nice, reheating things is fine.  Cookies turned out well in this as did broiling steaks.<br />~ Biggest pro is that it's helpful with a toddler - she cannot reach this so it's much safer to use than the oven.<br />~ It's pretty - much nicer and fancier looking that my old crappy toaster oven.  (In fairness, that thing was way over 10 years old.  But it was never a looker and was hard to get clean.)<br />~ Speaking of clean - this is pretty easy to clean.  The slide-out crumb tray is nice to use.<br />~ Did I mention it's pretty?  Really - I don't like things on my countertop but this is really nice looking and doesn't look at all out of place in a very nice kitchen.  If the thing is going to sit out (and it will - it's HUGE) then it has to look nice.<br />~ Heating is even.  I made a double batch of cookies for a Christmas exchange all in this since toddler was running around the whole time and they came out quite well.  My oven has a hot spot so this is appreciated. (I'm sure that's the convection feature.)<br /><br />What I thought would be better:<br />~ It takes a LONG time to heat up.  My small range oven takes about the same time!  So this becomes a waste of counter space as it's GIANT.  (Again, worth it to not have to use an oven a toddler can reach and pull open, though!)<br />~ The knobs feel very cheap and the timer knob skips around sometimes when turning - worries me it won't hold up.  Sometimes the setting doesn't move until you've turned the dial quite a lot - I almost fear it won't work sometimes!  (Admittedly, I'm probably over-panicked by this - my car's heater will sometimes go the opposite way when dialing it - in MN when you're trying to get it warmer in your car (at -20F outside) and you see the temp go down, down, down as you turn it to the right it's reason to freak out!)<br />~ The magnetic pull-out is only when it's set at the middle for toasting.  The bottom (baking) and top (broiling) don't pull out. I'll be totally honest - I haven't found the magnetic pull-out to be as awesome as I expected.  But it's my MIL's favorite thing about hers so everyone will feel differently about it.  I guess I use it mostly in the lowest position so I don't use the feature much.<br />~ After only a couple months of use I've had E05 three times now.  (I'm guessing we use it maybe 3x a week at the most.)  Once about 1 month after getting it - using it to bake - husband saw it, asked what it meant, I said I didn't know, he unplugged it and plugged it back in and it worked again.  Then a couple of weeks later I had it while broiling.  It worked again after unplugging but errored out again.  Since we were in the middle of getting dinner ready, I switched it to bake at 400F and it worked the whole time.  I now have an email in to Breville. This error code says it needs intervention from them so I assume I will have to send it back.  NOT COOL!  My Amazon delivery date is just under 90 days now so that's good, at least!<br />~ It's seriously huge.  It's so hard to really understand how much space something will take up until you put it on your countertop.  I wish I would have cut up some cardboard to mimic the size first.  It's OK since it replaces a toaster oven and a toaster (old toaster oven didn't make good toast) but my old oven was small enough to put in the cabinet when not in use so this takes up much more space overall.  I need to rearrange my countertops to get it a new home.  The only positive thing is that it's currently sitting in a space where I tend to drop junk so at least it's preventing that mess!  :)<br />~ I feel like toast takes forever!  I guess I never timed my toaster but when you set it for toast it takes 5+ minutes!  That seems like a long time to me. I should have realized it'd take so long to heat up and toast since it's so big inside.  Of course the heat in a toaster is much closer to the bread so I should have realized but I didn't.  Not a big deal since we don't make toast much but for those who rush out of the house in the morning with toast to eat on the way it would be important.<br /><br />Tips from me for using this:<br />~ With my old toaster oven (small and CHEAP) I could cut cooking time and temp down.  With this I keep it on the prescribed temp in the recipes and typically for the length listed as well.  I experimented a bit assuming it'd be lower temp and shorter cooking time  but it's not - it's pretty big inside so it makes sense.<br />~ The pans provided seem good - I've used the round pan (to make cookies) and also the broiler.  They washed up well (not in the dishwasher - not recommended.  I've been good and haven't put them in there even though I put EVERYTHING in the dishwasher.)<br /><br />I guess in retrospect I would seriously consider a bit smaller oven with convection.  This is definitely dependent on your needs for size of oven.  Of course, I may have had the same concerns/issues with another model so I'm really only second-guessing myself since it's so huge and because I've had the error code now.  This is expensive for a toaster oven so I expect it to be really impressive.  I heard such great things about Breville and the only way to get the convection feature was on the big unit - in retrospect I wish I'd considered another brand with convection that would take up less space and be cheaper.  If they fix whatever this E05 error is but the until continues to have errors after the warranty expires I'll be kicking myself for not getting the best offering Costco had - they'll take anything back.w much space something will take up until you put it on your countertop.

Her small old Black and Decker toaster oven has lasted more than 20 years!  I bought it for myself years ago and gave it to her after she got married.

Don't know if that's a sigh the button is going or not, but I'll let you know if it breaks. But even with the relatively high price tag, I'm satisfied with the oven. It's averaged out to $42/yr in cost, not bad for an oven that enables me to avoid using my standard oven most of the time. Living in Tampa, with our warm weather, that's a real value!<br /><br />Original Review - I've had my Smartoven for over 2.5 years and thought it time to review it. Well, it's still working, and working well. We're three retired people living under one roof, which means three meals a day at home, unlike you working folks who might only cook dinner at home.<br /><br />In the morning is when it gets used the most, for toast, English muffins and bagels. We all eat when we feel like it, so it's normally used 3 times. Bagels and English muffins are superb. Toast is very good, too, if we flip it about ¾ of the way through the cycle. The lower element doesn't seem to be as hot as the upper on the toast setting.<br /><br />We've used it extensively for frozen and homemade pizzas, and it does a very good job. It will hold a 13&#34; round pizza stone perfectly. I've also used it for casseroles and very frequently use it for garlic bread and other roasted or toasted goodies. Really, anything your full size oven will do, this one will.<br /><br />My favorite pan for it is the 10x13 Thunder Group Sheet Pan. It fits very well, and is nicely made, not at all prone to warping.<br />[[ASIN:B002KE5OL4 B002KE5OL4]]<br /><br />UPDATE - June 2014<br />I finally found something that doesn't do well in this oven. It's a large lasagne in a heavy ceramic pan. I made lasagne in one of my big Emile Henry stoneware bakers. It was just too much weight and caused the rack to fall out of it's track when I tried to slide the rack out of the oven. After sliding it out about 1.5 inches, the rack fell. I'm pretty sure that using an aluminum pan, or certainly a smaller one, will work just fine. FWIW, the lasagne was terrific, like most everything that comes out of this oven.k fell.

The first one failed after 16 months. The failure was the LED panel just shut down. Breville was very nice to replace it after the warranty had expired.<br />The second one works well except that you cannot see the information on the LED panel unless you look down at it. If your oven is on the kitchen counter it can be seen. Mine is at eye level on an open shelf and it cannot be seen. You'd need to get on a step stool to look down at the LCD panel (or tilt the oven down so you can see it).<br /><br />I have written back and forth to Breville USA. The customer service guy, Matt, responded with pointed comments. His last comment:<br /><br />&#34;Well, it is a “counter top” toaster oven. It isn’t meant to be installed in cabinetry (in fact we try to advise highly against it, the product is not insulated). So we would not assume (especially in the design phase) that a consumer would be at eye level of the toaster oven.<br /><br />I would not call this a malfunction but unfortunately it may mean the product is not a good fit for your needs.&#34;<br /><br />The interesting point is that if their design team changed the LED for an LCD panel (like microwaves have) you could see it from anywhere.<br /><br />So, I recommend the oven if it is going to be used on a counter top.

First thing I notice is that the unit is big! It also requires at least 4&#34; of air space around it for venting so it will gobble up counter space. Secondly, the oven gets very hot. One of the reasons I wanted a toaster oven is to save our a/c in the summer and keep the kitchen cool. Heat emanates from this oven especially from the top and front door glass; it feels like more heat than my regular wall oven!

Cooks pizza like a charm.  Reheats leftovers without much thought.  The settings are very intuitive and took little time to understand.  (I find that toasting bread would never need to go past 4 so don't know why the scale goes so high)  The backlit display is wonderful and easy on the eyes in low lighting spots.  It is quite solid and sturdy and won't slide around on the counter when opening and closing.  The finish fits right in with the brushed chrome of all my other major appliances.<br />This IS expensive but does all it claims and more.

On the down side, just before Christmas and about the time the 1 year warranty was up the oven just stopped working!  I contacted Breville and they agreed to replace the oven with no question.

Neither of these issues are a problem for me. The knobs are light but I don't think I will expect anything more of them than to turn. I dont expect them to support any weight. The fan is audible but it is by far not the loudest appliance in my kitchen. It is great to have a smaller oven as an option to my standard oven.

The Delonghi oven has a light but doesn't have the flexibility of the Breville.  The Breville oven appears to be desirable at first blush until you dig into the details and realize that you need a flashlight to watch your baked goods, and any member of your family could be badly burned if they come in contact while the oven is operating.<br /><br /> In their zeal to be good consumers, it seems we have forgotten to wonder why it is that not a singe international corporation can manage to design and build a simple oven that performs basic functions safely and easily.  Instead reviewers vacillate between the choice of this unit versus that unit versus another unit, each of which are fatally flawed.<br /><br /> We might step back and consider the possibility that this is no accident.  Furthermore, it appears that these international corporations are succeeding in profiting by providing us the the illusion of a modern product, without actually providing truly safe and functional appliances; because doing so would not be profitable.  Instead we are encouraged to buy \\""Potemkin Village\\"" appliances and then discard them when they malfunction.

I have already used this far more than I did my old range oven, and now I can use that valuable space (new cooktop only with space beneath).

We needed one big enough to be practical as a second oven and we very much wanted the \\""auto-eject\\"" rack feature we had on the Krups. After considering and rejecting many makes and models, I saw a mention of the Breville BOV800XL in Consumer Reports. None of the stores we had been to had the Breville, so I chased it down at a local department store and bought it.<br /><br />The \\""Smart Oven\\"" meets all our requirements and more - it doesn't take up any more counter space than our old Krups but it is taller, and has enough space to hold roasts. It has the auto-eject rack feature we wanted (when the rack is in the center position) and the crumb tray pulls out from the front. (It astonishes me how many manufacturers get this detail wrong.) For toasting it does an excellent job - toast is evenly browned and there is more than enough adjustment to satisfy me and my wife. I eat bagels, and the bagel cycle results in a nicely crisped inside and still chewy outside. The \\""smart\\"" part is how it adjusts the time based on how hot the oven is from previous cycles - I know some other toaster ovens claim to do this, but the Breville is the first one I've seen that appears to get it right.<br /><br />Usually I am not a fan of digital controls, but the Breville's are easy to use with knobs, not a keypad. The display is easy to read and changes color based on whether it is cooking or not. Even the power cord has a nice design with a loop on the back of the plug for easy pulling (we unplug appliances when not in use.) Do note that it has a three-prong plug. I just hope the controls continue to be reliable - we've had the Breville for three months now and it's been fine, but who knows how it will fare years down the road?<br /><br />We liked the Breville BOV800XL so much that when the daughter of friends announced wedding plans and had a Black&Decker toaster oven on her \\""registry\\"", we bought her the Breville instead and she and her husband-to-be love it as much as we do.tead and she and her husband-to-be love it as much as we do.",2014-01-05

After verifying a lot number they emailed me a prepaid return label.  FedEx picked up the box on monday and that afternoon they sent out a brand new one.  I received the replacement in the mail today.  (5 days with a holiday).<br /><br />As for the quality of the SmartOven, we probably use ours 3-4 times a week.  Our full-sized oven takes 20+ minutes to get to 350 so this was the original reason we bought it.  We use ours like a small oven, but haven't really used it for a toaster.<br /><br />One definite advantage is that if you buy a metal 9x13 pan (like the calphalon) it will fit in the SmartOven as long as it doesn't have handles.<br /><br />Because of their quality and my recent experience with customer service I plan on purchasing Breville products if I have the option.

Unfortunately, Mr. Grumpy (who does secretly, mostly love his Breville oven) has another disappointment to share.  He bought the oven in May of 2011, and just this week (July 2014, a little over 3 years later) it died.  He was adjusting the temperature while cooking when suddenly the heating elements shut down with a *ZZZZAP!* as though a fuse WITHIN the oven had blown. Mr Grumpy called Breville Customer Service and was given the option to pay $119.00 (shipping both ways included) for them to either repair his oven or replace it with a refurbished one.  After (of course) some grumping, Mr. Grumpy paid up, boxed the oven (keep that original box!), and schlepped it over to FedEx Office to ship to Breville in Torrance, CA.  The jury is still out, but the shipping costs alone would have cost Mr Grumpy close to half of the repair fee, and Mr. Grumpy certainly knows that we live in a perfectly imperfect world.",2013-12-22

The first one I got was DOA but when I called, they sent a new one out pretty quickly.  That unit has been working fine until today.  I had an issue where you would set a mode/temp and click Start but the oven would not heat up.  I opened the thing up to see if there were any obvious signs of damage inside but it looked fine.  Funny thing is while I had it open laying on its side, I tested it by turning it on just to make sure the relays engaged.  Low and behold it started heating up.  I put it all back together and back in its place and then it wouldn't heat again. So fully assembled, I again placed it on its side for giggles and low and behold it started heating again.  I gave the side that was facing up a whack (its the right side if looking from the front) and now it works as it should.  My guess is that maybe one of the relays was a little stuck and having it on its side had gravity to help it along and maybe the whack was enough to clear it??<br /><br />As for actual oven performance, we have Gaggenau ovens for larger tasks so this Breville we use probably a lot more just to heat up and cook small things when we don't want to waste too much energy cranking up the big oven.

We recently bought a place that needed a LOT of kitchen help.  There was an in-wall oven that existed, but the knobs were missing, and it was about 30 years old.  Kicked it to the curb.  Funny little aside about that old pile of junk.  I had a little bet with my wife that it wouldn't last 24 hours on the curb.  She apparently doesn't know about resourceful scrappers with F150s that are approximately the same age as the old oven.  Yeah, came home the next day, and it was gone.  Love that.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the awesomeness of this &#34;toaster oven&#34;.  I originally bought this to heat things up at my shop.  Did a great job with bagels, leftover pizza, you know, the normal things you use a &#34;toaster oven&#34; for.  Ended up bringing it home after we jettisoned the in-wall Easy Bake Oven.  Started considering using this for regular cooking.  First major thing we did was brussels sprouts on the stalk.  I'll try to upload a picture of what we did.  It was brilliant.  We've made Pernil (look this up), cookies, pizza (yeah, need to upload this picture also).<br /><br />2 months ago, we did buy a full sized convection wall oven, but have had to put off the install since the project has gotten bigger.

We still love the toaster oven, but started to have issues with it last year.  It burnt (literally with smoke and sizzle) it's thermal fuse.  I repair a lot of electronics and replacing the thermal fuse was quite a bit more difficult than it should be.  It was quite an involved repair.  It's been working for a while, but now I'm having some control board issues (repeated presses of the start button before it will actually start).  I'm debating on whether or not I should do another repair or just replace the thing.  I do love the toaster oven, but for how expensive this is, it should last longer than 3 years.<br /><br />Functionally, my only real complaint with it is how hot the top gets....like instantly melt plastic hot.  I realize it should get warm or maybe even hot to the touch, but it shouldn't get hot enough to start a fire.<br /><br />---original review 5-stars---<br />We've had this toaster oven for about two weeks now and absolutely love it.  We initially bought the Panasonic NB-G110P Flash Xpress Toaster Oven, but immediately returned it due to the size (way too small).  At first we were apprehensive about the Breville simply because of the price, but decided to splurge.  So glad we did.<br /><br />The toaster oven is very attractive and looks like it should for the price. Controls are very intuitive.  And....it toasts / bakes / broils perfectly.  So far in the two weeks we've had it, we've used it for toast, convection baked potatoes, and bagels.  I thought the &#34;bagel&#34; setting was a gimmick, but it really isn't.

We have the optional cutting board for the top, which does allow usto place things on top of the oven. The pizza stone and pan both make for excellent home pizzas. If you will only be using for toast, it might be a bit much; however, as we do not have a microwave and use this oven in lieu of our full sized ovens for small baking/roasting as well as toasting, it is one of most frequently used kitchen appliances. Excellent construction, and easy to clean.",2013-12-11

I sent an email to Breville customer service asking for the location of the authorized repair facility nearest Phoenix. Arizona.  Two and one half days later I received an email from Breville with an apology for the issue and a request for model number, batch code and purchase information.  Thirty three minutes after sending the requested information, Breville emailed to me a return label and instructions for shipping the old oven.  The email also stated that once Breville received confirmation from FedEx that my oven is on its way back they would ship my replacement out the next available business day. The following day I took the return label and oven to the nearest FedEx facility for shipping.  Later that same day I received an email from Breville stating that my new oven was being processed for shipping. Breville also sent a tracking number for the old oven.

The \\""Element IQ\\"" feature really works well as does the convection feature both of which are described very well in other reviews here on Amazon.<br /><br />My issue is that the oven just died on me for the second time. The first time the oven was still under warranty and Breville replaced it for me (shipping *to* them on my dime).<br /><br />Now, about 13 months later the oven has died yet again. No warning, it just simply stopped working while we were toasting some bread.<br /><br />I've sent an email to Breville to see if they will replace it again. This appears to be a pretty common complaint from searching these reviews.<br /><br />I'll report back with my eventual resolution. I can accept that products sometimes go bad, this will boil down to how the company elects to deal with the issue.<br /><br />** Updated 12/16/2013 ***<br /><br />Breville responded to my note and are willing to swap out my non-working unit for a refurbished model that will come with a 6 month warranty.  This is even though the original purchase was over 2 years ago and the subsequent replacement was over 1 year ago.<br /><br />A slight correction to the above, they actually *did* pay for postage to ship the original unit back. The charge I mistook for postage in my ledger was actually the cost we elected to incur for packaging the oven since we did not have anything suitable within which to return the unit.<br /><br />I'll post a final update as to the final disposition of this exchange.<br /><br />** End Update **<br />** Updated 1/5/2014 ***<br />We received the refurbished oven from Breville on 1/2/2014. There was a small delay in shipping the oven back due to both Christmas (FedEx had limited options for picking up the package that week) and my being out of the country for a bit in there. True to their word, the day FedEx came and picked up the old oven (12/27) I received a notification that the new oven was being shipped.<br /><br />The new oven works fine. This one only has a 90 day warranty associated with it but, given Breville's track record of standing behind this product, I'm not that concerned.<br />I've bumped the rating up from 3 stars to 4 stars since the oven is working again at no cost to me besides a bit of waiting. As I said in the title of this review, when it's working the oven is great.<br /><br />** End Update **oven works fine.

I am one of the two, though I won't rule out both. There are a large number of alternative ovens which probably will cook just as well for half the price.<br /><br />I also bought the associated cutting board accessory, which was equally priced into the realm of the ridiculous.<br /><br />The oven does work very well as a conventional replacement. It pre-heats and bakes quickly, and evenly. The screen is easy to read and the controls are fairly easy to use. The pans which come with the unit are of respectable quality, shape, and size.<br /><br />Beware that the rear of the oven gets extremely hot. If you have a backer board on your kitchen countertop which might be damaged by the exposure to heat, you should shield it. The top of the oven also gets very hot, but that should be expected and might even be a useful feature. A cutting board on top should be all you need to prevent any accidents.<br /><br />There is no interior lighting, much to my disappointment. I would have a higher respect for this toaster oven if it had one, but it does not.<br /><br />The convection fan is not overtly loud, but it is not silent either. You will be able to hear the fan while the unit is in use.<br /><br />The LCD display is bright and easy to read. It turns itself off, lest it be obnoxiously bright, after five or ten minutes. The LCD backlight is orange while the oven is powered on, and blue-ish white when not in operation.<br /><br />The power cord uses a NEMA 5-15 grounded plug, but the cord is fairly short at approximately four feet in length.<br /><br />The timer offers a range of 1-minute to 2-hours, in 1-minute increments at lower times and 5-minute increments above one hour. The baking temp range is from 120F to 450F.<br /><br />Internal dimensions on the lowest rack offer 11-inch depth, 13.5 inch width, and 5.25-inch height.<br /><br />The control interface is devoid of any extra features than what are obvious, with the exception of the ability to switch from Fahrenheit to Celsius measurements. You can not adjust the brightness or contrast of the LCD, there is no clock, you can't adjust the buzzer in any way, use it as a countdown timer, or create any kind of a custom program.<br /><br />The dial knobs feel cheap, rough, and plasticy. It would count this as a criticism, but this might be due to restrictions on available components which are durable under the duress of heat over time. They are functional, though I find the selection resolution too high. It is annoying to me that I must twist the knob so many times to make timer adjustments.<br /><br />The exterior of the unit is true brushed stainless steel without any kind of plastic coating. One exception is the two elbows of the door handle, which are both a silver-painted grey plastic.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good oven, but the price is ridiculous. I would be an embarrassed chump if anyone I knew found out what I had paid for this.

Price was better, and returns (hopefully) would be easier than having to ship something back. I wanted something to 'supplement' my big oven, that would be it's equal in ability, but smaller for when I didn't want to heat up the big one.<br /><br />The pro's:<br />1: I like the controls: very easy to see and use. (It did take a while before I remembered to use the 'frozen' button when that was necessary. Without it, things just took longer, and at first, I wasn't sure why.).<br />2: I like the quartz heating elements: they stay clean and haven't gotten grungy looking!<br />3: I like the drip tray: easy front access and easy to clean. I had some gooey stuff spill over, and then I used the oven a couple of times before I knew it was there. I ran the tray under hot running water, scraped the heavy stuff off with a nylon scraper, and the rest came off easily with a soapy sponge!<br /><br />The con's:<br />1: It needs an interior light. The inside surface is dark and doesn't reflect anything onto the food. I actually keep a small flashlight next to the oven.<br />2: It needs to be better insulated: I wonder if it has any at all, especially the back, where it feels like it's only one panel of sheet metal. The top gets hot too, but at least that can be used as a food warmer. Yes, do make sure you have enough clearance space around it.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with it so far. I hope it stays that way!",2013-11-28

Had to go out and buy all new pans and dishes to fit this thing....not happy about that. The size is not normal .....at least to me....trying to find a muffin pan to fit in this that holds 12 muffins is seemingly impossible. Since it only comes with one rack stacking 2 side by side is your only option. Lets move on. It has the same problem, tho not as bad as the unit it replaced. I wonder how many folks use a OVEN THERMOMETER with their unit? Right off the bat I found out it was not heating up to the temperature I had set it to. Had to set it to 370 to get 350.....at least it was easy to make adjustments but for a $300 oven .....you should not have to do all of that. The pre heat thing is something to deal with as well.......I guess it beeps when ready so I'm guessing that's when you put what you want to cook ....but I just burnt a pizza. I'm going to put this thing thru the paces and see how it does......mean while see if I can find someone to repair or try and purchase another Faberware unit somewhere.....it by far is the best  counter top convection oven I have used.....without all the bells and whistles.I'm giving this thing 2 weeks....then back it goes if it does not preform like it's suppose to.",2013-11-07

I rely on small ovens almost daily, and this oven is without a doubt the best product of its type that I have ever used. It comes to temperature very quickly, and it bakes, broils and toasts evenly. Unlike other, less expensive toaster ovens I've used, the convection fan makes a real difference in uniform heating and browning. The toast and top-brown settings are remarkably accurate. That is, if you set the slice count and desired darkness, the result is just what you'd expect. The pizza setting, which automatically selects the cooking time by the size of the pie you input, is also accurate.<br /><br />The various heat cycles, the temperature setting, the time setting, the three rack positions, and the ability to (de)select the frozen food and convection settings, taken together give you a great deal of flexibility that can handle just about every baking, broiling, reheating, and toasting situation one is likely to encounter. I particularly like that the power to the heating elements is varied depending on the heat cycle and temperature selected. This is far more effective than other ovens, which typically can only turn select heating elements on or off.<br /><br />The capacity of the oven is very impressive, and for many purposes I no longer need to use my main oven. In addition to the included square, metal baking tray, it also fits a 13-inch diameter round pizza stone (an accessory I recommend). The top of the oven also has a large surface that serves as a warming tray or plate warmer.<br /><br />After extensive use and testing in a variety of roles, I simply cannot think of any serious negatives to this product. The one thing I think can be improved is the continuous-rotation selector dials, particularly the heat cycle dial. The dials do not have firm click positions or detents, and can be a little vague in making selections. Up/down push buttons or rotary switches with definite positions (click detents) would be an improvement. My main concern is how durable these switches will be with extended use, and time will tell.<br /><br />I highly recommend this toaster oven.ry switches with definite positions (click detents) would be an improvement.

The top insulation as well as the front glass pane let a significant amount of heat escape the unit.  For me, that is the tipping point.  I was afraid to accidentally bump the unit and be burned.  I took a digital thermometer and read the top temperature and found it to be 179.2 degrees Fahrenheit while the oven was 450F.  I was unable to get a solid coupling with the top and know that this temperature is an underestimate.  Water spritzed onto the surface immediately boiled indicating a temperature much nearer to 212 F.<br /><br />I would expect an extremely hot shell on a cheap model of convection oven but not on something of this price point.  I am returning this oven to the store I purchased it at.  I had high hopes for it and really wanted something that wouldn't \\""heat my house\\"" like the standard oven.  This unit does not fill that need, it heats the house every bit as much as my full size oven.  I am hoping to find a insulated model but don't know that this is available.  Oh well, I tried.  I can do more detailed temperature measurements of the exterior if anyone is curious, the current levels are more than enough to thoroughly burn my skin and succeeded in doing so.",2013-10-27

We use it for almost all our meals, so we must be savings lots of $$$ on our electric bill.  And since it heats up quickly, I know it helps keep our kitchen cooler in the summer.  We think it is fairly easy to use as all the controls are self-explanatory.  I like the idea that the timer doesn't start till the right temperature is reached and most operational things are well thought out.  The crumb tray designed to open from the front is pure genius.<br /><br />Disadvantages:  Successful cleaning of the crumb tray is absolutely impossible.  If a stain happens and is overlooked, forget removing it.  It gets welded to the surface.  And there's nothing on the market that will remove splatters from the oven walls.  I've tried everything.  I even checked out YouTube videos for help, but to no avail.  Some will tell you that they clean their oven after every use, but few people have the time for that. The brown stain that builds up on the stainless steel that's visible surrounding the door when it's open also won't clean up very well.  It seems to bake to the stainless no matter what I use.  Breville gets really bad marks for me on this. This toaster oven is well designed considering what other brands have to offer, though I do think it's overpriced and almost impossible to clean successfully.<br /><br />Here's a question:  I'm wondering if the Breville stainless steel is really steel?  Could it be brushed aluminum??  Aluminum is really hard to clean.  It reminds me of the aluminum kitchen faucets out now. . . the same dull metal look.  This occurred to me when I compared it to our new Panasonic microwave that's made of stainless steel.  It looks entirely different (shiny and sleek) compared to Breville's dull stainless.  Maybe it's just made of a different type/grade of stainless cause it's less attractive and certainly harder to clean.<br /><br />Updated due to finding more information January 2014:  I found a review of the Breville oven in which they said they use oven cleaner on the oven walls.  They're careful not to spray it directly into the oven itself so the ceramic burners don't get ruined.  They said they spray it onto to a cloth and then apply the cloth to the oven surface.  I haven't tried that yet but will write back if it works.  Nothing else does!nuary 2014:  I found a review of the Breville oven in which they said they use oven cleaner on the oven walls.

The second sample has been OK, so far. I agree with most that this is a good oven, and the extra size increases its usefulness. Aside from very good performance, the controls are both simple, and allow for a wide range of options. The lack of a light is not a critical flaw.<br /><br />Consumer Reports thought the oven did a very good job on baking and broiling. It did an even better job toasting, scoring an excellent for full batches of toast, and maintaining consistency between batches. It also scored very good for single slices of toast, toasting color range, and ease of cleaning. For ease of use, Consumer Reports awarded an excellent. This was the magazine's top rated toaster oven.<br /><br />As a class, Consumer Reports does not like toaster ovens. Only 4 of 22 tested models got recommended. In addition to the 800XL (73 out of 100), the number two rating went to the unique Panasonic FlashXpress NB-G110P. It combined solid performance (70) with speed. It requires no pre-heating. Unfortunately, it won't let you broil. The smaller cousin of the Breville 800XL, the 650XL (68), combines a smaller size with fewer features and a lower price.

It usually takes me a minute to get to the oven and insert the food, meaning the cook time could be off, however, I have yet for food to come out under cooked.<br /> * Too expensive.  Not sure it's worth $250.  It can be found cheaper refurbished, sometimes on woot.com or other sites<br /><br />Other Notes:<br /> * It's big, but not as big as I expected from the reviews.  It's size was a non-issue for me, but smaller kitchens may have trouble fitting it, even though it's not much bigger than a typical toaster oven.<br /> * The bagel setting heats the bottom of the bagels more.  I don't prefer a soft top on my bagel, but I can place them upside down or use the toast settings.<br /> * It does get hot externally, but is there a toaster oven that doesn't?<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this at a lower price point or for those that cook a lot of toast or bread.

You can add minutes, as you desire and there is plenty of room for the roaster pan without bumping against the side walls.  This keeps the oven from splattering against the side walls and no mess.

It is square, OK that does not sound earth shattering. Well sqaure is good, the top of the oven can hold items in a warming tray while you are still cooking. Most other toaster ovens just take up space, this one utilizes it. I made toast the day I got this oven, and let me tell you you it was the best toast I ever ate, nad my wife agreed. The oven has three rack positions, and it says wher the rack goes for each type of cooking right on the oven door. The controls are very simple to use, and the display is easy to follow. The really cool, and I do mean cool thing is the automatic middle position rack eject. There are two magnets in the door that pull the rack part of the way out when in the middle position. This is for people who forget the oven mits. This toaster oven shows when it is preheating, and then signals when cooking. It beeps when done,but only twice. Two settingsF/C .Elements get very hot very quickly, be carefull. I suggest leaving the dorr open till it cools. The plug, yes the plug, I have never seen the plug mentioned in  areview, but you will see it here first, maybe. The plug is thre pronged, and unlike other three pronged plus it has thre ditinct wires. This plug has a hole in hte center of it, why you well might ask, and<br />I might tell you, you put your finger in it and pull, so you do not pull it out by the wire. Ok that was the good stuff. I only reall have one complaint, that is why 4 not 5 stars. No oven light , you can not see anything in side while it is cooking, very very naughty BREVILLE. Also there waranty is only for one year, an additional waranty from Square Trad is available for a nominal charge, I felt it was worth it ,considering the  oven was  $249.00 The IQ Elements put the heat where it is needed.",2013-09-27

I looked for a long time for a replacement and finally decided to purchase this oven. It's more expensive but, I really like everything about it. There are many adjustments available and so far it has worked very well. It's very sturdy and has a nice look. It only comes with one rack and I did buy an additional rack so I could warm up or bake on two racks. Every time I use it I am impressed with how fast the convection bakes food that comes out of the oven perfect. I really like not having to heat up my large oven to bake 2 biscuits or warm some leftover that needs to stay crisp. It's works.

So it was quite a challenge to find a \\""large\\"" oven nowadays.<br /><br />Even though this Breville is smaller than what we were looking for, it can still handle most of the chores.<br /><br />The best feature is the bright LED display, which shows more than enough info.  I got this for my grandmother who has poor vision and she hasn't had a problem seeing the screen after using it for 1 1/2 years.<br /><br />And this thing is tough.  It was accidentally knocked onto the floor once and the only damage was a slightly bent door/handle.  After carefully bending the door frame back into shape, using a cloth-covered vise and pliers, it's hard to tell anything ever happened to it.  I fixed it myself because Breville does not sell just the handle; one must buy the entire door assembly from a Breville dealer.<br /><br />It is powerful, too.  So much that at higher temps, it occasionally makes the lights blink!  Not too fond of that much draw on the electrical in the house, so the oven is used at more moderate temps.<br /><br />When our Euro Pro dies, we will also be getting a Breville oven.

Get this big one, not the smaller ones, as it has more features and capabilities and is worth the extra $.  It fits a 13&#34; pizza pan or roasting pan or baking pan.  You can make things you'd normally have to make in a big oven, and they come out perfect and faster and more energy efficiently than using a big oven.  If you have a very small kitchen or are living in a dorm or a bachelor apartment, this can be your oven and toaster all in one.<br /><br />It has convection, a fresh or frozen button, pizza setting based on size of pizza, e.g. 6&#34;, 8&#34;, 10&#34; etc., a pull out crumb tray, and if you use the rack in the center position, it pulls out via magnet when you open the door.  There are settings for the rack printed on the door.  Get the cutting board that is made for it that sits on top.  The top gets hot, so this way you can put things like oven mitts and this handy tool:  Norpro 1229 Silicone Oven Rack Push/Pull.<br /><br />I also recommend the Breville 13-Inch Pizza Crisper (the oven comes with a pizza pan, but this one has holes to crisp the pizza), and the Granite Ware 0535-4 Everything Roaster, 3-Piece, which fits perfectly.  Besides the pizza pan, it also comes with a roasting pan and broiler pan.<br /><br />I've had many a toaster oven in my time, but this is the best one I've ever found.  Even after several years of use, it stays clean, unlike others I've had that get all grungy after a year of use.<br /><br />I also recommend the Breville YouBrew coffee maker with built-in grinder.

The front half of the oven cooks faster than the back half. And the right front cooks faster than the left front. I expected better heat distribution from a convection oven & I've spent a lifetime in the restaurant business. One final complaint & I'm being nit-picky: it takes 5 minutes to preheat it to 400 degrees. For such a small AND expensive oven, I would expect it preheat much faster. My regular oven does it only a minute or so slower.<br /><br />One other small aggravation was the included pizza pan. A non-stick pizza pan? Really? Absolutely useless!",2013-09-18

It's worked incredibly well for us, and we've been very happy using it for toast, waffles, garlic bread, potato wedges, and, of course, frozen pizza.<br /><br />In fact, it does so well at the latter that we now generally prefer premium frozen pizzas over ordering out. It's so much cheaper, and very quick and convenient due to not having to preheat (and clean) a large oven.<br /><br />Major pluses are the very roomy interior size, the availability of size-appropriate accessories, the ease of the interface, and the looks of the oven on the counter.<br /><br />Minuses are the roomy exterior size (but the available cutting board or a third-party substitute will help you reuse the top as space) and that it's not always wholly clear which of the presets--which mostly control which elements are on and for how long--is best for what you're cooking unless it falls right into Breville's categories. The manual's good overall, but slightly vague on this particular point.<br /><br />One concern is noise. A lot of reviews mention noisy convection fan issues. Mine made a couple of loud off-balance-sounding noises early on, and I thought I was going to have to return it. However, it appears to have &#34;broken in&#34; after those first couple of times and is now pretty smooth and quiet. I'm still a little apprehensive, to be honest, but it's working well currently so that's easing up. However, be aware that you may end up having to swap one before you're done.<br /><br />This has more or less replaced our regular oven for everyday cooking, and we're thrilled with it. I have no problem recommending this unit.",2013-09-11

The BOV800XL is by far the best among the toaster ovens we've owned. It has good temperature control and works well for baking mini-pizza, cookies, veggies, warming up bread etc. The controls are intuitive and pleasant to use, and the unit looks sleek with its nice display and stainless finish. It is also fairly compact and light, so fits well on a countertop. And the convection fan is quiet in use. For about two years, we used the BOV800XL every day.<br /><br />However it's important to be aware of the limitations of any toaster oven. These models lack insulation around the oven cavity, and for the most part feature a single layer of glass on the door. As a result their exterior can get very hot. They have exposed heating elements. And they're lightly built; the convection fan on our first unit failed after three months. Breville replaced the entire unit under warranty, which is outstanding customer service on their part!<br /><br />If you use your toaster oven only for baking and are willing to pay a premium for the BOV800XL, it might be worth considering a commercial countertop oven instead such as the [[ASIN:B001NAAS30 Cadco POV-003 Commercial Quarter-Size Convection Oven]]. They're solidly built, have many more features, and use less energy. On the minus side they're costlier, larger and noisier in use.<br /><br />Once we got the Cadco, we retired our BOV800XL.",2013-09-08

I contacted Breville Customer Service thinking all I would need to do was purchase a fuse or something minor like that.  The oven still worked perfectly but the difficulty in reading the LED panel was annoying.  I was shocked when the customer service rep told me he would send me another oven AT NO COST TO ME.  He arranged to have a new Smart Oven sent and asked me to return my old one in the box the new one would be arriving in.  He even sent me a POSTAGE-PAID label to use in returning my old oven.  The only stipulation was I had to return the old oven within 30 days, which I gladly did.  I use my Smart Oven every day and would have been really sad if I had to send it back before they would replace it.  Words cannot express how amazed I was to have this kind of customer service experience.

It toasts it so slow that it actually bakes the bread making it more like a crouton than toast. The toast is pretty and smoothly brown, but it comes out hard as a rock. So hard that I went back to check that the bread wasn't stale when I started. It was fresh. My little $10 toaster from Target actually makes better toast -- not as pretty, but better tasting.<br />Baking -- One of the main things I use a toaster oven for is baking potatoes. My $30 Black & Decker makes great baked potatoes in 30 minutes. Golden, crunchy brown on the outside and soft on the inside. After 30 minutes in the Breville, the potatoes are barely showing any brown and the insides are still raw. It takes another 20 minutes to get them minimally done. This is with convection on.<br />Convection baking. I bake a LOT of chicken in the NuWave oven. It always comes out well done and moist in 14 minutes with a crunchy \\""crust\\"". In the Breville it is barely done in 25 minutes. The convection feature, other than making a LOT of noise, does not seem to make any difference in the cooking time regardless of what you are baking.  Also I never got the crisp outer crust on anything (potatoes, chicken, steak) like you would expect from convection.<br />Tried making a pizza, which the Breville comes with a pizza pan so you would think it would do well, and it was burning on the edges  (about 1 to 1.5 inches in) long before the cheese in the center even melted. The crust never got  crunchy as it does in my normal oven.<br />Overall, it seems that the oven does not get as hot as other toaster ovens and therefore takes longer to cook. The convection option does not seem to work -- did I mention it is VERY noisy? The fan is turning. You can set it on a low temp and put your hand in and feel the breeze. It just doesn't seem to do what its supposed to do. Had I not thrown the box away (I know, I'm stupid) I would have returned it. For $250, this has been a huge mistake for me.

I was interested to get something a bit studier than many others that are on the market (dials often breaking off etc etc), hoping that it would last a bit longer, and also to perhaps get something a little larger so I could use it as a back-up to my regular oven, making extra batches of things when having guests over.  I wanted to be able to use it not just for toasting, but also for other uses such as baking etc.<br /><br />Our regular standing oven works fine but to have this new extra source of baking is very helpful to me when having to cook quite a number of dishes at any one time.<br /><br />Our regular oven takes a while to heat up to the temperature I want it but our new Breville Smart Oven heats up in no time at all - saving me even more precious time.<br /><br />Even though I knew this oven was big, I still decided to go ahead with it despite having a very small counter to place it on. Making the extra batches with this new Breville means I can freeze more dishes for when I need it. This saves me time and energy, making it not just a convenience but a necessity on some days.  I purchased an extra shelf and tray especially for this purpose, which is a great way to get good mileage from this wonder oven. As recommended by some reviews, I also purchased the board which sits on top of the oven giving a little more \\""counter\\"" space back that it itself takes up. It also functions to protect the top from heat.<br /><br />I am not a digital person at all and wondered how I would get on with this oven having digital settings. I had such a pleasant surprise as it is so easy to use. One dial for time, one dial for temperature / type of function one needs and the other for the toaster setting.<br /><br />I highly recommend this oven and trust it will last a lot longer than all those other toasters on the market - matching it's wonderful sturdy metal body. It's strong, good looking and effective. What more could you want? It does cost more than a regular toaster oven, but you get what you pay for - and I think this is well worth it.g and effective.

Some said it got really hot and that worried me.  I'm happy to report that, while it does get hot, it isn't unreasonably so and the positive attributes far outweigh this small negative one.<br /><br />I've had the toaster since April of 2012 . I waited to review it so I could tell people my experience after using it a while.  Other than the heat, I can't think of a single negative thing about it.  It's easy to use (I never read the manual), so easy in fact that I bought one for my father this year for Father's Day.  He won't read a manual either and at almost 90, I don't expect this'll change.<br /><br />We both like the automatic shutoff feature the best.  I never have to worry about something burning in the oven.  The toaster settings let me choose 1,2 or more pieces and how brown I want them.

I wanted more than just a toaster oven (I have a decent toaster) and needed something that would cook fast-with convection. After reading reviews, I decided to spend the money and go with this oven. So far, I am very happy with it. I can cook a batch of tater tots in less time than it takes my big oven to preheat! Baked potatoes are fairly fast and taste much better than microwaved ones. Baked fish comes out nicely as well. I have not baked any cookies or cakes since both my husband and I are diabetic and we can't eat those things. It is nice to be able to sit a platter on top of the oven to keep something warm while the veggies finish cooking and you get the table set. The outside of the oven does get hot, so you do need to keep space around it. Still, my kitchen stays much cooler than when I use my conventional oven.<br /><br />I did order the Polder KTH-711-47 Trivet, Stainless Steel [[ASIN:B0040X3SG6 Polder KTH-711-47 Trivet, Stainless Steel]] to put the oven on to protect my wood counter.

Reheating pizza is fast and crust does not get soggy like it does in the microwave. May consider getting the pizza stone, but we really don't make that many pizzas from scratch any more. Already have two large baking stones collecting dust on top of my frig!<br /><br />Did not order the bamboo cutting board as I have plenty of nice cutting boards and could not see a reason to add another $40 to my order. You can't store anything on top of the oven and the cutting board did not seem to serve any real purpose.<br /><br />I did heat the oven without anything in it (as directed) before using it. There was a slight odor (as indicated) but it simply smelled like the furnace when it first comes on after being off all summer, or like an electric heater being used after standing for a few months. As indicated in the directions, there has been no odor whatsoever since. So far, I have had no need to clean the inside of the oven.  I use the roasting pan which came with the oven and simply line it with a little no-stick aluminum foil. Have yet to need to wash the roaster.<br /><br />It is also very quiet and the controls are exceptionally easy to use. The auto shutoff is great so I don't have to worry about leaving the thing running.

I am totally in love with the plug with the hole in it as I have very bad osteoarthritis in both hands and pulling a plug is often a short trip to hell, so the design of this plug is about my favorite device in many years - too bad all manufacturers don't use this style.  The second thing I like is the magnetic tray slide when you open the door.  The overall design is nice.  The outsides do get quite hot, so be sure to leave the recommended space around them and do not put flammables nearby.  I made lemon squares today and baked it in this oven for fun - with the convection oven should have cooked one minute less than the shortest time recommended, but they are still fine.  Someone mentioned the lack of a light and I agree it could have one but can still see quite clearly through the glass.  Another reviewer mentioned lack of a clock.  Since there are clocks on about every appliance in the kitchen, plus two decorative ones, one less clock to reset with power outages and/or DST is an advantage for me, not a drawback.

The convection feature works great (Unlike some toaster ovens that claim convection and you can't even feel the air moving by the fan).  This oven was worth every penny I spent on it and if it works for many years it will have been a great bargain as it is more economical to use than a full sized oven.<br /><br />I was so scared to spend this much money on a toaster oven.  I have no regrets!  This oven does everything it says it will.  I don't even use my full size oven anymore.  This unit heats up super fast, cooks evenly (and I mean *evenly*), looks beautiful and is one of the best ovens I have ever used.  I do have to warn people though:  If you have a home with old wiring and don't have a circuit that can handle the load this oven will not work!  (Trust me, it's worth putting in a circuit for this).  I have used this oven for everything but toast so far and have had no problems at all.  It is a wonderful addition to my kitchen.  Highly recommended.",2013-08-03

BUT IT BREAKS IN ABOUT 2 YEARS,"UPDATE 2014-11-21:<br /><br />The electronics are proving to be junk and the unit seems about to die.<br /><br />At about 20 months, the oven started getting a little hinkey. Pressing the \\""START\\"" button would just cause a buzz/click and not start about 1 in 10 uses.<br /><br />Initially, the buzz and click tricks you in to thinking it's working and you walk away... until you come back and think, WTF, it's not even hot. Then it increases to a failure rate of 1 in 5, 3 in 10, 2 in 5, 1 in 2.<br /><br />I am currently at about 22 months and about half the time the unit will buzz and click but not start.<br /><br />According to other reviews, this is common. It will short out between 366 days (1 day after the warranty is up) to 2 years. I believe I am very close to having it give up the ghost.<br /><br />There is no reason this thing cannot be made to indefinitely. The only way so many of these to short out is if Breville is like GM and their electronics and design them to fail as soon as possible just outside of warranty.***<br /><br />Having said that, it's still the best I have found. So unless I can find a better toaster oven, I will be kicking myself for buying a new one when this one meets its design-flaw death.<br /><br />However, buyer beware. If you are not willing to buy one of these every 13 to 30 months, look elsewhere.<br /><br />***NOTE to Breville prevarication flacks: The Breville oven is such a power hog that it would cause the kitchen lights to flicker when it was running. I had a contractor, Scott Smullen, install a dedicated line to the outlet for the Breville which eliminated the flickering. Therefore there is no claiming that my unit shorted out because of bad power.<br /><br />EARLIER REVIEW:<br /><br />This thing is incredible! We use it for toast (more slices, more sizes than a regular toaster), frozen pizza, reheating pizza, cooking meats of all kinds, heating our plates (on top when we're using it for something else, inside when we're not) and a myriad of other things.<br /><br />I've lived with six other toaster ovens over the last 30 years and hated them all. I was horrified when my wife wanted to try yet another one but then she came home with the Breville BOV800XL.<br /><br />Almost everything about it is perfect - except for the price - and the weird digital screen that is slow to react and has a back-light I wish I could control.<br /><br />When asleep, the digital screen has to be woken up. When on, it stays on excessively long.<br /><br />I'd like a \\""ON\\"" button to wake it up and a \\""BACK LIGHT on/off\\"" button to turn on the back light when needed (you have to press buttons/turn knobs to wake it, then wait a few seconds before being able to turn the knobs to change settings from, say, toast to broil; the back-light then comes on and stays on for far too long after use).<br /><br />The best part? The convection feature - which does have its own button to turn on and off. When on, it really seems to cook things much faster.<br /><br />We've had it since December 2012 and we've used it an average of twice a day since then and almost never use the main oven now.

Forgetting to set the toast slice count to the actual slices gives less than perfect toast. But this is an operator problem not the oven's.<br /><br />I do like the toast, it comes out the exactly the same time after time. I love the toaster hash browns, toaster waffles come out good. Hate how it cooks rolls, not good with cookies either, but I am playing with finding the right settings. Frozen pizza's come out frozen in the middle and burnt on the edge. I hate to say it, I like my el-cheapo Black and Decker better as there is a much lower learning curve. Hopefully, as I become smarter than the oven, I will like it but right now, I cannot recommend it and now only give it 3 stars.<br /><br />June 2015:  I have had this oven for 2 years now and have grown to like it more and increased my rating from 3 to 4 stars.

This isn't really the fault of the unit - at 1800 watts, it can only put out so much heat. But broiling a steak produces a baked steak, not a broiled one.

This was a one time replacement and so far (knock on wood) this oven has worked without issue for well over a year. I'm pleased by this gesture from Breville.",2013-07-15

I wanted something that would do the work of a regular oven but that would be more convenient than using the standard oven - especially in the summer in a condo!<br /><br />My concerns that I had about the size (inside and outside dimensions) are not an issue - to my delight!<br /><br />The oven is roomy enough for a 12\\"" pizza, and can use many of my existing pieces of bakeware.  The only thing I replaced was my pizza stone as my existing one was a little too big for the Breville.  The larger pieces of bakeware will be put in the pantry until we have family or friends over when we're making food for an army.  The size is perfect for making things just for my husband and me - preheats quickly, and the results are fantastic!  Cinnamon rolls, garlic rolls, quesadillas, pizza, toast, bagels, fish sticks, all have come out perfectly.<br /><br />I thought it might take up too much room on the counter, but I still have enough room for a dinner plate to be put on the counter in front of the oven.  (Standard size kitchen counter)  I placed the oven on the counter next to my stove & microhood to be able to use the hood vent if needed.  So far - it hasn't been necessary.  The kitchen cabinet above gets warmer from the under cabinet lighting than it does from the Breville below.<br /><br />Overall, I am extremely happy with my Breville oven, and really wish I would have bought one a long time ago!!

It died today, July 8. Can't say I was every really crazy about it.  The exterior gets dangerously hot, the knobs feel cheap, it toasts poorly and the convection feature doesn't work well--baking is uneven. In fact, the convection fan started making weird noises a few weeks ago. They're sending a new one (or will it be reconditioned? I didn't think to ask)and I hope that I get more than 4 months out of the new oven. All-in-all a disappointing purchase. I wanted and expected to love it.<br /><br />Update:  I received my replacement oven from Breville yesterday and it's significantly better than the one I bought from Amazon.  For one thing the door has rack height suggestions printed on it so there's no guesswork and I'm pretty sure the last oven did not have a \\""cookie\\"" setting. This machine seems to have a few enhancements. With the old toaster I had to set the browning control to 5 or 6 to get decent browning. The old oven made that humming electronic noise on \\""toast\\"". The new one is completely quiet and the toast was perfect at the preset. So it seems the old one was a piece of crap right out of the box. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.",2013-07-08

It does it all: roasts, toast, fresh pizza, reheating meals (no soggy microwave).  And with great controls to fine tune your heating needs, this is close to the ultimate oven.  After 10 months though, the oven stopped working.  Try to search \\""Breville smart oven will not turn on\\"" and you will see it has a history of this issue.  Most people say it's a defective thermal fuse.  I'm currently in the process of getting the oven replaced under the 1 year warrantee.

I'm not sure if Breville has started to ship these ovens with this problem addressed, that would be a good thing to research before buying.  I guess I'm lucky it broke down before the warrantee expired.<br /><br />Overall I can't give the oven too low of a score just because it really does rock when it works and you take care of it the right way.

In the winter, we place our plates on the top to warm them up.  It must self clean because it is like new after months of use.  I wish the company had included a larger cookbook with it.

Once you've gotten your preferred toast setting dialed in, it will create the exact same doneness every single time with no effort at all. Frozen waffles come out nice and crispy, not soggy or burnt, which are the two results you risk if you get the time wrong on a traditional toaster oven.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the control panel's knobs are made of cheap plastic made to look like metal. Everything else about the oven feels high quality, but the controls feel so chintzy it's always a disappointment whenever I have to use them. The knobs move around a little as you turn them, contributing to a cheap, not quite solid feel.<br /><br />With this oven, you'll shell out $250 and get a fantastic high-performance appliance that does its job very well. If you can get past the cheap-feeling controls, you'll definitely feel you got your money's worth.",2013-06-11

I like the way it toasts - both speed and results.  Convection fan is a little quieter now than when new.  The more I use the oven, I realize it was a good purchase.  Had considered getting the smaller version, but I like the size.  Sometimes wish it was bigger, but have never wished it was smaller.

I already have a Convection Oven and Microwave combo and the main oven has a convection option as well.<br /><br />After the death of an old over the counter Back and Decker toaster oven I looked around to find that nothing seemed to be designed for just toasting.  Toasting was always done with a timer with no settings for how you wanted it done.  There are the slice toasters buy I really don't like them as they are hard to clean and don't typically fit the kinds of bread I use very well.<br /><br />I eventually bought another Black and Decker toaster with convection.  It was a disaster.  It was impossible to set a time where you could toast anything without burning it.  You had to sit there and watch it the whole time.  It was also very easy to leave the thing on by accident.  The kids did this on multiple occasions.<br /><br />The Breville BOV800XL is just about the only toaster I could find that had all the requirements of my wife and I.<br />It actually toast bread based on setting like lighter darker and then you just press a button.  Perfect every time.<br />It will toast a frozen Bagel perfectly as well using the frozen setting.<br /><br />What I did not expect was how well it would work for normal cooking.  Because of it's size there is very little you can't do with it.  The timer and baking options make anything that will fit possible and it will fit a lot.  We use this thing much more than the normal oven and convection microwave.  The reheating setting also works very well for leftovers.<br /><br />The front mount crumb  tray was a requirement of my wife's and is perfect.  Easy to pull out and clean.  So easy you will actually clean it.<br /><br />Lastly: I seldom bother to write reviews but I want people to know just how good this thing is.,2013-06-07

It's easy to use.  It's attractive.  It's solidly-made.<br /><br />Here's the however -- it's a b..tch to clean.  The interior is dark, so you need some kind of direct light, and, because it's so deep, it's hard to see how clean the back is, even in good light.  More importantly, the interior is full of crevices and indentations that hold onto cooked-on grease and are hard to get into with a cloth or brush.  Unless you clean the oven each and every time you use it, you're going to have cooked-on grease.  It's hard to clean that off even the smooth areas of the oven's interior, much less all the nooks and crannies.<br /><br /> If all you want to do is make toast, this is not the appliance you would buy.  You buy this oven for its capacity to perform many of the functions of a regular oven -- baking roasting, broiling, etc.  And these uses leave spatters and grease on the walls, just as they do in a regular oven. I roasted two Cornish hens in my Smart Oven and they came out beautifully, but the inside of the oven was a mess (much like my regular oven the day after Thanksgiving, when there is turkey grease all over it).  Breville should have taken this into account when they designed it.  You can use oven cleaner on your oven the day after Thanksgiving, but you can't use oven cleaner on the Smart Oven and you'll be stuck trying one cleaner after another with disappointing results.<br /><br />My old convection oven, which is no longer made, was self-cleaning, which is what this should be. In fact, when I bought this, I read the Amazon listing, which promises a \\""non-stick interior\\"".  NOT SO! The interior quickly accumulates grease and food spatters.<br /><br />I was willing to spend $250 for an oven this good.  I'd have spent $300 for a self-cleaning feature.  But now I'm annoyed that I didn't actually get some of what I paid for -- a non-stick interior.<br /><br />Be warned!",2013-06-07

You can heat up a Tumble Weed tiny home easily when cooking with this oven--you can scorch your skin when coming into contact with it. This unit CANNOT be placed in an open space and in an area where there is people traffic or where young children can have easy access to it. It must be placed in a well ventable protected location. That's the only negative. (Use heavy duty extension cord if you need to.)<br /><br />Pros:<br />Light weight, stainless steel, clean construction, nice detailing, easy to use, browns perfectly according to your setting once you've tested and trained yourself to make it work to your needs, not a lot of instructions to learn or memorize, easy push and turn knobs, has multiply tray accessories, quiet mechanism, someone mentioned the loud alert beeps--I don't find it annoyingly loud at all; for me it was just right, not too soft and not screaming loud; it was perfect to draw my attention to a serious activity. I think for portable ovens you need to pay attention when using them and the alert beeps does this perfectly in my environment, city ground noise. This unit cooks fast at 1800 watts which is good to save on electric bill (cooks quick in shorter time). I have toasted/cooked croutons, bread, pork chops, chicken, lamb chops and cookies. I do not put a whole regular size chicken into this oven as it would bring it too close to the top heating rods and I don't want the fat from the chicken skin to come into contact/squirt onto those heating rods which could cause grease fire and smoke. I cut the chicken in half when using with the Breville.<br /><br />I recommend, no matter where you put this unit, placing 2 side by side 1'x 1' non-high gloss ceramic tiles beneath it. And because I have mine on a metal rack, I also have a ceramic heat board/sheet, cut to size, placed on top of this oven unit to cut back some of the ascending heat. This unit has the entire rack-shelf to itself; I put nothing near it. Light weight reduces installation and this unit feel like there is no installation when it gets cooking. However, the overall quality and the cooking element with practice accuracy of its cooking capabilities makes this unit a keeper. I just hope the extreme heat does not destroy the control elements inside the unit.le.<br /><br />I recommend, no matter where you put this unit, placing 2 side by side 1'x 1' non-high gloss ceramic tiles beneath it.

What a waste of time and energy. It took about 20 minutes to come up to temperature and then 40 minutes to cook. My kitchen got hot etc. What a waste!<br /><br />Today this oven arrived and I wasted no time putting it too use. I roasted chicken and the results were just as good as my full size oven.

They can do a chicken or a 5 pound roast easily it in and it comes out perfect.  It heats up fast, cooks faster so costs less to run.  Their electric bill should come down even though they will be cooking more, the Breville is more effecient.  I like that it shuts itself off.  No worrying about a fire.  They love it because it is easy to use and clean.  For a few dollars more the large size is definately worth it.  When I went to visit I made some fresh garlic butter for them.  I put the garlic heads in the toaster oven and forgot about them.  I remembered them about 30 minutes after they should have been done and thought they would be ruined.  The girls reminded me that the oven shuts offs when the timer is over.  When I got them out they were cooked perfectly, better than my oven at home so now I may have to get myself one.

My wife had her eye on the comparable Cuisinart, because she thought the size would make it more versatile than our old 4-slice B&D. I was, however, turned off by multiple customer reviews of the Cuisinart, citing poor handle design, making it easy to burn your hands when opening the door, poor crumb tray placeement, and plastic parts that simulated metal, but cracked with use.<br />The Breville was more expensive, but amortizing the difference over anticipated years of use, it is insignificant. The design and function of the Breville are terrific, and we now use it, whenever we are cooking for just the two of us, as our primary kitchen oven, with considerable savings in electricity, and increased convenience. Works like a charm, with intuitive controls.<br />The only reasons I don't award a fifth star are (1) lack of an interior light, and (2) the top, on the outside, gets too hot to touch (a teak cutting board, available as an inexpensive accessory, fits on the top, is useful, and tolerates the heat while protecting the user from exposure ). ,",2013-05-25

As I was toasting bread last week, it stopped in the middle of toasting and I thought it was done, but there were no lights, no indicators and it was just dead.  I thought maybe I blew a fuse, but everything else I plugged into that outlet worked just fine.  I moved it to another outlet, but it just won't work.  Now I'm on the hunt for my original receipt because I got a good price on it at Bed, Bath and Beyond, but I'm not sure I have the receipt.  I should have bought it from Amazon so I could always go back and get the receipt, but who knew a $200 oven would just crump before the year warranty was up?  If I cannot find the receipt, I will still write to the company and see what they will do.  From the reviews here, I am probably SOL when it comes to customer service.  I will update when I do that.

I will update again in the future regarding the refurbished unit.<br /><br />**Update post-call to Breville customer service - I called Breville this morning (on hold for 21 minutes, but it IS Monday morning...) and was pleasantly surprised to speak with someone who, although my oven is one year out of warranty, is going to replace the unit with a refurbished model that will have a 90 day warranty. They are sending me a free shipping label for me to return the dead oven to them. I'll update the review after I've received the refurbished model.**<br /><br />This oven has been great up until now (exactly one year past warranty - to the day). I loved this oven, and the outside stays cool enough not to burn or melt things that are near it. I give 5 stars for the performance it has given up to this point, but 1 star for the following:  It just up and died. It worked fine yesterday, but now the display is totally dead on the panel, as if there's no power. I first thought it was the cord or a bad electrical outlet, but it is definitely the machine.<br />  Since it is now out of warranty, I went to the Breville website which listed one appliance repair shop about 25 miles from me. When I called them they told me they DO NOT work on Breville appliances, and they don't know why they are on the Breville website... I spent close to an hour searching for small appliance repair shops in a 50 mile radius who work on Breville, and after 6 phone calls, it looks like nobody works on Breville ovens. One small appliance shop owner I spoke with, although unable to help me, suggested that the cost of repair would likely be pretty close to the cost of replacement. Awesome...<br /><br />I tried filling out the \\""contact us\\"" form on the Breville website, but it keeps telling me \\""unable to submit form\\"" even though there are no errors in my completion of the form. After re-entering all the info twice more, I still can't submit the contact request (thinking it may be a browser issue I tried it in Chrome and IE, but same result).

It's attractive if you have to have it out on display and the clean up is easy with the stainless exterior and a front loading pull out crumb tray. Regarding function-My uses for this oven have been pretty simple. Baking biscuits and cookies, heating a few convenience foods and toasting.  I love that it preheats/bakes so much faster than my conventional gas oven as it saves us a great deal of time in the morning. Having gone from a family of 6 to just 3, it's great being able to bake just 1-2 biscuits or cookies for our son's lunch or as a quick treat, as any more than that would get thrown out long before they'd get eaten. Much less waste. I did find there was a bit of a learning curve to getting some things just right, but it really didn't take long. Because of that learning curve (and the fact that there were several complaints about inaccurate oven temps) I decided to test the oven temp using an oven thermometer I had that I knew was accurate, as it was always dead on in my gas oven. I was surprised to find that the oven would signal it was pre-heated long before the oven thermometer would reach the set temp, yet I was still getting good results. How could that be?! Despite the good results, I was concerned there could be an issue with my  oven so I searched the Breville website for information and found the following in response to a post complaining about the preheat indicator signaling long before the oven had reached the set temp.<br /><br />Breville's response:<br /><br />\\""The Preheat signal sounds at 75% of the target temperature. You may not be allowing enough time for the oven to reach target temperature. For complete temperature stabilization at the max temperature of 450F from start-up, including opening the door at the pre-heat signal, and then allowing full temp recovery it takes 10 minutes to stabilize.<br /><br />Why does the Preheat sound at 75% of the target temp? The software of the oven is optimized to provide the user with the fastest heat-up time to cook a given item. The critical factor to consider is that after the preheat time is indicated, and the door is opened, the temperature inside the oven drops dramatically. When the door is closed the oven must then recover back to the target temperature. This happens with every oven, big or small. By notifying the customer at the 75% mark we achieve the fastest overall cooking time.\\""<br /><br />Then a follow-up question ....<br /><br />\\""So, are we supposed to put the food in the oven at the 75% mark when the beeper sounds or do we wait until we think it's reached maximum temperature??\\""<br /><br />Breville's follow-up:<br /><br />\\""This pre-heat indicator is when you should put your food into the oven. If you wait until it reaches set temperature to open the door for the oven, you will lose a lot of the contained heat, and it will have to try to stabilize in order to reach that heat again. With testing in our machines, our engineers have found that putting food in when the beep sounds is the best time to cook the fastest and most efficiently with our ovens.\\""<br /><br />So sure enough, I tested mine again and it signaled at exactly 75% of the set temp.

The Cuisinart oven still worked fine, and my wife and I were always happy with it, but I wanted one that was a little larger in size.  My only complaint with the Cuisinart oven was many third party toaster oven cookware products would not fit in it.  The Breville Smart Oven is significantly larger without taking up more counter space and can accommodate many types of cookware for toaster ovens including a 13-inch pizza pan.<br /><br />The Breville Smart Oven arrived very well-packaged.  It was double-boxed and packed in Styrofoam for excellent protection from shipping damage.  Included with the oven were a broiler pan and 13-inch pizza pan.  A printed owner's manual is also included, which is very well-written and comprehensive.<br /><br />The Smart Oven is very easy to clean.  A major advantage over the Cuisinart oven is the crumb tray removes from the front, and the tray has a coating on it that makes it relatively non-stick.  The rack inside the Smart Oven is easily removed providing easy access to the entire inner oven for easy cleaning.  There are magnets that will automatically pull the oven rack forward when the oven door is opened (this only works if the oven rack is in the center rack position, though).  This is a really handy feature and eliminates the need for using an oven mitt to pull the rack forward when making toast.<br /><br />The controls on the oven are simple to use.  There are several quick settings for common uses such as toasting, baking, and cooking frozen pizzas.  Each quick setting can be easily modified to suit your purpose.  The display is bright and easy to read.  My only complaint with this oven is the knobs on the 3 dial controls seem to have a lot of play in them, which gives them the feel that they may not last long.  It is probably not the knob itself but the stem it attaches to.  Regardless, this is the only feature that makes the oven feel cheaply constructed.  So far I have not had any problems with them, though.  Everything else about the oven reflects thoughtful design and solid construction.  The top will get very hot during cooking (Breville promotes this as a way to keep food warm after cooking, although it is really more of a safety hazard).  I purchased the Breville cutting board that is designed to fit on the top of the oven without damage during cooking as a safety measure.  The manual advises putting the oven where there will be at least 4 inches of space around it on all sides.<br /><br />The Smart Oven cooks very well.  It bakes frozen pizza perfectly with the included pizza pan.  So far I have only baked 12-inch pizzas with it, but a 13-inch pizza would fit easily.  I have not baked anything else with it yet, but I have no doubt it would do so well.  The convection fan is on by default but can be turned off easily.  It is very quiet, and you will not even notice it's on unless you listen for it.  The oven makes perfect toast on top and bottom.  It toasts better than anything I've ever used in the past.  I purchased Breville's 13-inch perforated pizza pan to use with this oven, and using it makes perfect crispy french fries.  The perforated pan is definitely a worthwhile add-on.  I wish Breville would make a rectangular one to make better use of the oven's large capacity.<br /><br />There are a couple of minor annoyances.  The light on the oven's control panel stays on for quite a while after the oven turns off.  This is a waste of energy and bulb life.  The alarm to tell you when cooking is completed sounds off only once and the oven shuts off automatically.  It is not very loud, so it is easy to miss when the alarm goes off.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with the Breville Smart Oven.  It would be perfect with more secure control knobs, and that's the only reason I docked it a star in this review.  I purchased an optional 3-year warranty due to longevity problems noted byother reviewers, although I hope I never need to use it.  If you are in the market for a good convection toaster oven and have the $250 to spend, the Breville Smart Oven is an excellent choice.<br /><br />Update 1/13/16:<br /><br />I purchased this toaster oven in April 2013.

The only problem with this are two: there is no light bulb inside so if you want to see how the food is doing inside you have to open the door and slide the food outside. The second thing is the oven top which gets very hot. Its been just six months and the side of the frame where you open the door is getting discolored due to cooking.

We have baked, broiled, warmed, toasted, and roasted in it, and all the functions are great. We didn't have a toaster-oven before this one, and we bought it because our old toaster finally gave out. It is a bonus to have a second oven and one that's smaller so we can bake a potato or two without having to use our big oven. The only disappointment is that the Smart Oven isn't as well-insulated as a full-sized stove or wall oven, and therefore it heats up the kitchen more than I had expected. (I was hoping to use it in summer, when I usually hate to fire up the stove.) That said, everything else about the Smart Oven surpasses our expectations--it's easy-to-use and understand, even without reading the unusually clear owner's manual. The oven excels at toasting (such a relief after my string of unreliable toasters) and baking pizza, which comes out crispy and perfectly cooked in about 12 minutes, and, so far, everything else we've asked it to do.",2013-05-13

Works amazingly!,"I just had to leave another glowing review for this product.  My full size Kenmore oven takes over 20 minutes to get to 450.  This counter top oven is at 450 in under 10.  Also, its small size doesn't heat the kitchen up so much.<br /><br />I got way into no-knead bread cooked in a dutch oven at 450 but it roasts the kitchen out in my big oven and it was unbearable in the hot southern summer.  So I researched counter top ovens and Breville won my money.  The deciding factor for me was that a Lodge 10.25\\"" Combo cooker (the one that has a handle) fits.  Now I can bake my no-knead without waiting 20-30 minutes for my big oven to heat up, and without wasting so much energy and heat.<br /><br />I bake my cornbread in this in an 8\\"" lodge skillet.  My buttermilk biscuits rise up fluffy.  I make my frittata in a 10\\"" lodge skillet.  I roast covered casserole dishes and homemade pot pies.  I toast all my sliced bread in this too and I get consistent browning through back-to-back batches.  I reheat leftovers in it.<br /><br />The crumb tray comes out from the front too.<br /><br />Negatives:  The round baking sheet that came with it didn't last a year.  The non-stick coating began flaking off in places at 6 months though I still used it.  After a year it really started flaking badly enough that I threw it away.  The broiler pan that came with it is still going strong though.  So my only negative is with the quality of the accessories that came with it.",2013-05-09

It takes repeated pressing of start button to engage and even then you have to be very quick to get the function you want.  The Temp and Function selectors are becoming the same--unreliable.  This would be a much better machine if it were more reliable longer than two years---especially for the high price.  Nice Unit, good looking but We really could NOT recommend it, unless the cost was a LOT LOWER. Was hoping for a better unit by spending a higher price--not so with this one----LOOK ELSE WHERE  3 THUMBS DOWN",2013-04-26

I bought the Breville on a one-day sale at Amazon; it had been on my Wish List for many months since I needed to replace my tired Krups convection toaster oven.  I don't mind spending more money for a superior product and that is what this Breville is.  Here are all the reasons I love the Breville in no particular order:<br />1) it has a huge interior—it fits my 13-inch pizza stone or six large slices of rye bread or a store bought rotisserie chicken<br />2) it beeps when the preheat reaches the correct temperature (although I don't put my dish to be cooked in for an additional five minutes to get it really warmed up)<br />3) it counts down the minutes left to cook in any mode (toast, bake, broil, etc.); this is key for me because I like to have everything finish cooking at the same time, whether on the stove or in the toaster oven (think eggs & toast)<br />4) it beeps when it's finished cooking.....but you can hit the Start/Stop button to stop it early with no audible sound<br />5) I put my empty dinner dishes on top while the Breville is on to preheat my plates<br />6) the crumb tray really catches everything and is simple to remove & clean, and isn't even noticeable when inserted<br />7) it REMEMBERS what the last setting was for a particular mode; for example, when I choose the TOAST setting it will automatically go to &#34;6&#34; for darkness and &#34;2&#34; for slices<br />8) when the rack is in the upper slots and you open the door the rack comes out part way automatically to it's easier to remove or stir/turn over food being cooked [NOTE:  I wish it did this on the lowest rack level as well]<br />9) the display is very easy to read with the back-lit illumination<br />10) the door shuts securely with no heat leakage<br />11) it is very attractive in any style of kitchen and is less conspicuous in my small kitchen<br />12) the stainless exterior cleans up easily and looks clean longer than my old black Krups<br /><br />I've read the negative reviews, but like any product there are bound to be lemons; with good customer service to back up their product I would recommend this Breville to anyone.oks clean longer than my old black Krups<br /><br />I've read the negative reviews, but like any product there are bound to be lemons; with good customer service to back up their product I would recommend this Breville to anyone.",2013-04-25

When I didn't here back I called customer service and the lady said I could get a copy of my receipt from Amazon and she also said she was E mailing me a return shipping label for Fed Ex. I got the label within minutes and took the oven to fed ex. To my surprise the return shipping was prepaid. Within days of my shipping the unit I received what appears to be a brand new unit. It says it has a 90 day warranty. I was upset that this expensive unit failed in 17months but I was really surprised at how Breville stepped up to the plate and took care of the customer with fantastic service. No return freight, a new or looks like new unit and no cost and no hassel to me whatsoever. This is why you buy the best. Thankyou Breville for the outstanding customer service.",2013-04-24
US,46627199,R1HFYE0T0BXQHW,B001L5TVGW,608011455,Breville BOV800XL Smart Oven 1800-Watt Convection Toaster Oven with Element IQ,Kitchen,5.0,4.0,4.0,N,N,Very nice,"We live in a warm climate and have suffered blistering summers in the southern states we have lived in. Running the oven at a high temp for an hour/ hours to roast a chicken or vegetables just makes the kitchen miserably hot and makes the a/c run non-stop. So many dishes just excessively waste the vast oven space, thus wasting energy as well.  That on top of making the a/c run more finally prompted me to go in the market for a good toaster oven.  Consensus says this is the best one. So far, I believe it.  It is easy to use, it heats up quickly, the timer can be adjusted by the minute in either direction even after it has started cooking, the temp is easy to change even while cooking, it spills out little heat compared to a full size range oven, convection easily can be turned off (although I am loving the convection, it cooks food faster and is quiet!) and things have been cooking perfectly in it- perfect casserole and toast so far.  I need to go buy a handleless 13x9 deep baking dish/ cake pan now. It came with a sturdy pizza pan and a sturdy shallow baking pan with coordinating roasting rack.<br /><br />I was excited to learn from reviews that the shelf pulls out when the door opens be because of magnets in the door.  Come to find out, this feature only works on the middle self because of two metal bump outs on the back of the oven at the middle shelf position cause the rack to sit farther forward and thus in contact with the magnets in the door. Why only the middle rack, especially when it wiuld be most helpful with a hot casserole or chicken on the bottom?  Not a deal breaker at all, but I dont understand why they couldnt have made that feature work for all three levels. You move the shelf based on the function you're using to cook- bake/roast/reheat is bottom, toast/pizza/cookie is middle, and broil is top.  I havent owned it long, but I am loving it so far. I will update later.",2013-04-22

I purchased it from a competitor almost two years ago.  Main reason for my purchase was not wanting to turn the oven on, especially during the summer to make something (ie frozen pizza or cupcakes).  Now when I make a purchase like this that is rather spendy I do a lot of research.  I read reviews, research the companies, etc, etc.... I finally pulled the plug and picked up the 800XL.<br /><br />I sincerely have used it almost daily for almost two years, and it's STILL going strong!  I've made pizza, cupcakes, breakfast, roasts, chicken, toast, bagels, cookies, baked pasta, cheesecake, you name it I've probably cooked it in this oven, or at least tried.<br /><br />Everything I have made has come out excellent! When first using the oven, and using the convection feature, I'd keep my eye on it until you get the hang of the cooking times.  For example, when you turn the oven on for a 12\\"" frozen pizza, it says 22 minutes (or something close to that).  The oven will actually cook a thin crust frozen pizza on convection in 10 minutes at a lighter bake) (if you toss it in during the preheat it will be a darker bake).<br /><br />BL/SK Chicken breasts it will cook on bake in 20, and bone in/skin on will take 45.<br /><br />I've shouted the praises of this product to everyone who'd listen to me, I rave about it constantly.<br /><br />It cooks beautifully and if mine broke, I'd go buy another one immediately.

Great for small baking or broiling cooking. Easy to use. This one was for our second home in the mountains, now we will order another for our primary home. While it is pricey, it does have a quality shell compared to other ovens priced below $150.00, comes with three extra accessories like non stick 13&#34; pizza tray, broiling tray and bake pan. Don't be afraid to spend the $250. Delivery was quick from Amazon via UPS to the front door with free shipping. The oven is Made in China, and we hope it holds up well to our usage.

Love that the inside of the oven is large enough to accommodate a range of dishes that would not normally fit in a toaster oven.<br /><br />The top and left side get hot when the oven is in use, but the Keurig coffee maker is safe just a few inches away.

They asked for my receipt and model, etc., information and then offered to replace the oven with a reconditioned oven as a one time courtesy. This was about 18 months after it was out of warranty.

I always came back to the Breville 800xl. But couldn't bring myself to spend $250 for a toaster oven. Then I finally decided I had enough of cheap crappy toaster ovens. So I pulled the trigger and bought the Breville 800xl. Standing at the counter purchasing the toaster oven I had three customers standing behind me tell me \\""nice purchase you will love it\\"", they all had bought it and said they loved it. I got it home and my wife, who didn't know I was going to buy this, was not happy. She couldn't beleive I had spent that much money on a toaster oven. And it was too big too. Well I ran the first run that cooks off the manufacturing coatings. By that time my wife said ok lets try it with my meatloaf. I will tell you that my wife is a terrific cook and her simple meatloaf is legendary in our family. So we started to preheat the oven while she was prepping the meatloaf. She was shocked that the toaster oven dinged it was at 400 deg in 3.5 minutes. She put the meatloaf in and 40 minutes later we were eating. She mentioned that she couldn't beleive how high the meatloaf was in the cooking container she used. And how juicy it was as she cut it. Short story we both agreed that it was the best cooked meatloaf we had ever had, so moist it was wonderful. I used it to toast bread for breakfast this morning and again a stellar performance. So far after only one day, we are thrilled and my wife is ok with the $250 price, as long as it keeps on performing like this.",2013-03-27

This purchase made sense. We wanted an oven that was versatile enough for everyday cooking, reheating and toasting, occupied little kitchen counter space, and used less energy than the regular oven. The Smart oven meets all of our needs. The preset settings are AMAZINGLY convenient and spot on for the temperature - haven't had a burnt toast yet. The reheat function heats up a regular size dinner plate to the point where it is warm, not hot (acceptable for me). If you like your meal hot or warmer, then you can adjust the temperature to what you like to get the result you want.<br /><br />We baked cookies which turned out excellent. The outside of the oven gets quite hot, but we decide to use that to soften butter when we want to toast our bread. It fits most of our 9&#34;x11&#34; casserole dishes, so we will use this more often than our full size oven. The baking non-stick surface is truly non-stick and easy to clean with hot soapy water. I'm looking forward to baking our first homemade pizza in a few weeks.<br /><br />The price was right. We chose NOT to buy the warranty given the number of reviews that showed high reliability ratings from past users. We intend to use this for at least 5 years, or until Breville come ups with a SMARTER convection oven that will not only cook/reheat food, but also tell you how bad your cooking is....<br /><br />In a nutshell - invest in the oven.

I can tell you that I am not living in regret, and glad that I made this purchase.  It toasts bread evenly, unlike most, if not all toaster ovens.  Not sure how it does it, but it does.  Plug in, push start, perfect bread!  That simple!  Oh, if you keep your bread in the frig, click the toaster temp up to 5 (as instead of the preset 4), and it works just the same.<br />Next to the microwave and the frig, the toaster oven is the most used appliance in the kitchen for my family.  I think that this oven makes it the 5th toaster oven that I have owned, and it just straight up rocks!  The biggie for me is the fact that its internal compartment is larger that most all other ovens that I have owned; however, the counter space size is about the same as other large capacity TO's.  The oven comes with a standard rack, non stick pizza oven tray, broiling tray and pan.  There are three different positions in the oven in which to put the rack.  The magnetic door (to pull the tray out of works as it is suppose to), and is quite nice.  The oven is heavier than most ovens, but looks and feels like a much higher quality oven than most.  Standard size aluminum foil wrapped around the bottom crumb pan/ tray is a must to keep things looking new.  I think that this might be the only brand of TO's I will buy in the future (if needed).  I cannot find any cons with this machine so far, other than when you fire it up the first time, the protective film or stuff that they use to keep the elements fresh stinks something awful.  I recommend that you do your initial heat up outside to prevent this from stinking up your house.",2013-03-08

Until it Died 2 Months After Purchase,"When I visited my mother-in-law last fall, she had this oven. I fell in love with it over the week we were there and looked into buying one when I got home. At first I balked over a $250 toaster oven and hesitated to buy it. I read reviews, and saw that a not insignificant amount of reviews mentioned the oven dying within months of purchase. Even my mother-in-law said she had an issue when she cooked an entire chicken and the supports for the rack broke and it fell down and had to be replaced. But I figured, what are the chances? It's a great toaster oven and I'll take a chance.  Well ...<br /><br />We grew to love this toaster oven and used it several times a day. It preheats FAST and much faster than my full-sized electric oven. Because of how big it is, I don't think we had to use the actual oven in the 2 months our Breville worked, and it saved time. I never liked toaster ovens in general because I thought they heated unevently, but this one hasn't had that problem and my food comes out great. The only issue with cooking is that I think the toaster settings could go higher.  I like my toast lightly toasted - I mean, lightly golden with no evidence of burning whatsoever. And to get my toast like that, I need to have it on setting 6 of 7, where I'd have a regular toaster on the lightest setting.  Perhaps it's because of the dense, whole grain bread I use, and that if I'd used flimsy white bread it would take a lower setting. But if you were looking for really dark toast, I'd think a regular toaster would do a better job. It also takes a lot longer than a toaster - I think for 2 slices on setting 6 it was 5+ minutes.<br /><br />I do wish the setting dials would respond faster.  When I try to change it between settings after the oven has been idle, I find myself turning it a few times before it \\""wakes up\\"" and responds to the fact that I want it to do something. Not a big deal, but a noticeable issue. I love how large it is, and that it is now for the most part an oven replacement. Very easy to clean, and even things that got burned on (like cheese) don't leave black stains like in my old oven. About a week ago I said to my husband that despite the insane cost, I was glad we invested in it, as it truly is a great oven.<br /><br />Then on Saturday I put a pizza in to cook, walked away, and 10 minutes later came back to a dead oven and a half cooked pizza. I thought it might be the outlet (I just had the washer/dryer going, so maybe I overloaded a circuit?), but I moved the plug to 4 different outlets and it was still dead, as if it was not plugged in. I checked the circuitbreakers and everything was fine.  I plugged something else in all those outlets, and it worked just fine.  So it was definitely the oven dying, just like many of the reviews mentioned. We received the over 12/18 and it died on 3/2, 10-1/2 weeks later.<br /><br />Had to wait until Monday to call Breville. Waited on hold for 35 minutes and started a claim with Omarr. After giving him some preliminary info, we got disconnected. Thankfully Omarr was smart enough to call me back right away. We finished the claim, and I told him how on Amazon that there were a LOT of reviews about this happening. He admitted that it had happened a bit with an earlier model, but that my oven was a newer model (he said the exterior looks the same, but the internal stuff was changed a bit), and that this was only the second time he'd heard of it happening.  (For the record, our \\""batch #\\"" - engraved # on the back of the oven - is 1222.) While we were on the phone he sent an email with a FedEx slip to return the oven at no charge to me, and said that once the oven was received by them, they would ship out a new one.<br /><br />I shipped it out and they estimated that it would take a week to get to the New York address that the oven was being returned too. However, even though Omarr said that they would need to get it back first, I got an email from him with a tracking number that they shipped my new oven out yesterday (2 days after I had called and mailed back the broken one). I did reply to his original mail with the packing slip and confirmed to him that I had mailed it, so maybe they were able to check the tracking that it did, indeed, go out and trusted me. Tracking info says that the new oven should be to me by next Monday, which is exactly one week from when I first called them. Omarr was a great, responsive customer service rep and I'm very happy with the service I received from him. And I don't think a week's turnaround to get a new oven is unreasonable at all.<br /><br />Hopefully the new oven will work well, and more than 2-3 months. I'll update the review if I have any further problems.<br /><br />In summary, the oven itself (when it works) gets 5 stars from me. Their customer service gets 5 stars. The fact that the oven died so soon and the hassle of having to package it up and ship it back get 1 star. So I've averaged this out at 3 stars. If you do decide to take a chance on this, save the shipping box until the warranty runs out, just in case!<br /><br />Update: New oven arrived 3/11, one week after I had shipped out the broken one. The first thing I noticed is that the knobs have an entirely different feel to them - in my review I mentioned the sluggish response and how I'd spin them until it \\""woke up\\"" - that's not the case with the new one. I did notice though that the knob to set the time does feel like it gets \\""stuck\\"" at some point. I'll be curious to see if this becomes a problem, or if the loose knobs on the other was indicative of the problem it did have. We'll see. So far so good - will update with any changes.ipped my new oven out yesterday (2 days after I had called and mailed back the broken one).

This is a common problem apparently. Replacing this is a real challenge - and I'm very good at appliance repair having fixed a refrigerator, microwave (another rattling fan) and two heat pumps in the past year. If you had to pay for this repair it would likely be more costly than the three year oven is worth. But I've used it daily for three years so is that reasonable?  Given the cost, I'd have to say it should have lasted longer.<br />Took me 2-3 hours to replace - hope it lasts another 3+ years.<br /><br />This review will concentrate on the use of this oven as a second oven, rather than a primary oven.  If you want to use it as a primary oven, there are other excellent reviews you should read.<br />I'd like to start out by saying that we've owned this oven for almost two years and it gets used almost daily, so we've done a lot of cooking in it.<br /><br />Why we bought this:  We purchased this item to replace a 20 year old toaster oven that worked just fine but was a countertop eyesore.  Also lacking in our kitchen was a good second oven, which would be useful for small items and for Christmas/Thanksgiving cooking where a second oven would help considerably.<br /><br />What's included:  The oven includes instructions, as well as three pans designed to fit in the oven.<br /><br />The good:  This oven's convection feature cooks more evenly than our main oven - a major compliment considering that this oven costs about 1/10th as much.  We've cooked large casseroles in it and had excellent results - what you'd expect for an oven at this price.  We've never cooked round pizzas in this oven as our main oven is used for that, but we often cook the rectangular Ellios (school lunch style) pizzas in it on the rectangular pan.  It cooks these evenly<br /><br />This oven preheats very quickly.  We like this as it takes 10 minutes or more for our main oven to heat up.  This saves time and energy for your everyday cooking of small casseroles, mac & cheese, and the like.<br /><br />There is a magnet in the door to pull the rack out a bit when you open the door.  This doesn't seem like a big feature but it helps when you need to grab a hot pan and can avoid touching the hot oven surfaces.<br /><br />You can easily fit 6 slices of the old style small bread (square) for toast, but only 4 slices of the larger bread loafs that are popular now.  The oven toasts evenly - no issues here.  It also has a frozen bread setting that seems to work fairly well, but we haven't used that feature but only a handful of times.  We also frequently cook bagels in it, and it toasts the tops nicely and also heats/slightly toasts the bottoms.  Best bagel toaster I've ever used.<br /><br />The bottom tray pulls out for cleaning.  This is a huge benefit over those which are hinged.  One of my sons frequently puts bread with cheese on top directly on the oven rack and the cheese melts and drips down inside the oven.  Cleanup of this gooey mess is fairly easy (just ask my son - he's the one that has to clean it up!)<br /><br />I can't comment on cooking a whole chicken or things like that - like I said, we use this as a second oven.  We also haven't broiled anything other than garlic bread, although I can say that this works just fine.<br /><br />The bad:  About the only complaint I have is the pans.  They are fairly thin stamped sheet metal that are enamel coated.  Cleanup is fairly easy - they aren't non-stick (fortunately - I hate non-stick pans) and after a brief soaking they clean up just fine.  They still look almost new after two years of use.  However, the pan we use the most (rectangular baking pan) warps considerably when in the oven.  The warp is almost an inch with a corner of the pan lifting off of the rack.  Once the pan cools down it returns to its normal flat state.  But this is a fairly minor complaint as we primarily use this pan for pizza and garlic bread, which is cooked at a fairly high temperature.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  After two years of regular use, I highly recommend this oven as a second oven for everyday use.ooked at a fairly high temperature.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  After two years of regular use, I highly recommend this oven as a second oven for everyday use.",2013-02-23

If this had been a $79 item we would have thought nothing of it. However for $250 we expect more. We returned and replaced with a Cuisinart TOB-195 and that was a mistake. TEh 195 is being returned after its first use becaues it is a safety hazard. The wife received a second degree burn the first time she opened the door. So the 195 is being returned and we are reordering the Breville hoping the temp knob problem was an exception and not the norm.<br /><br />Update 3/2/13 Received the replacement and it is poor quality also. The door is slightly warped and the crumb tray comes out about a quarter of an inch each time the door is closed. Not going to try for the third time being a charm. This oven was to replace a heavly used Oster that died from overuse. Guess we are going to return this thing for the second time and go back with the updated version of the Oster. Sometimes trying to improve on something that works well is not a good idea.<br /><br />Update 8/21/13 Oven is great so we decided to purchase it locally. This is the way to go, we purchased the oven in mid-March and it has worked great. In my opinion the problem is the oven cannot take the pounding it receives during common carrier shipment.

Most have the mechanical dial timers on them that make it hard to repeat how dark you want your toast. Then I found the Breville smart oven and decided to give it a try. We loved it! We used this oven almost every day at least twice a day and up to six times a day. We liked that everything is digital and very easy to control. It is large enough that we did more baking in this oven than in our range/oven. Then after three months almost to the day it died. Contacted Breville and after a few e-mail exchanges I shipped them my broken oven and they shipped a brand new oven to us. It took about three weeks to get the replacement oven which I thought was a little long but all in all not to bad. I gave it one star because at $250 this oven should last years and not months. If you look at other reviews I am not the first one to have this problem. I suspect that there is design flaw where the electronics fail do to the heat because this oven does get warm.

I wanted to wait a while, before writing a review, and I guess this is long enough.  We purchased it in 2009 and used it almost daily.<br /><br />This is a wonderful appliance.  We are a small family of 2 and occasionally 3 people and we can use it for most meals.<br />It is also a convection oven, and can bake a small batch of cookies, beautifully.  It takes a little while to toast, but not really that long.  You plan around it and get used to it.  Toast comes out perfectly.<br /><br />Frozen pizza?  Wouldn't cook it any other way!  This oven gets the top and bottom cooked.  Baked chicken breasts, roasted vegetables, baked potatoes, brownies, meatloaf.... you name it !  It cooks almost anything.<br /><br />It is well made and we have never had a problem with it.  In the instructions it does say not to use aluminum foil.  Some of the reviews I read complained about that.  I called the company and the very professional woman said that you CAN use aluminum foil to line cookie sheets and baking pans, but it should stay inside the pan, or be wrapped tightly, just over the lip.  She said , what they do NOT want, is for aluminum to touch the sides, bottom, top of the inside of the unit and it should not touch the heating elements.  Ok... I can do that !  EASY !<br /><br />I would highly recommend this Smart Oven by Breville to anyone.  It is a nice 'second' oven for cooking/ heating rolls, if there is not room in the big oven.  Pies, desserts, or d orves, etc.  You can save time and electricity by using this instead of heating up the big oven, I would think.<br /><br />I have no cons to write about, even after all this time.",2013-02-16

My husband wanted an oven like this to use in place of our micro-wave. We warm our food in it, bake in it, bake potatoes in it, do everything in it we would do in a large oven. We love this oven. We are very careful to keep it very clean looking as if it was brand new. After almost two years everything still works on it and it looks as if it WAS brand new. We are very pleased with this purchase. We place our food on a heat-proof plate to heat our food and then slip the plate out onto another little larger plate OR we put food on a sheet of foil, heat it and then slip the foil onto a cool plate. We also bought the pan that fits the oven and leave it in the oven at all times linned with foil unless we are baking. That seems to help keep it clean. We have a large kitchen with a lot of counter space which is a good thing because this oven is much larger than your average toaster oven. The Convection feature keeps the temperature even everywhere in the oven. We use the warm feature a lot to keep food warm for a late cowboy or two that is coming in late for a meal. We are in love with this oven. We are very active for our age...we are 77 years old and on the go!  We have hired help and a ranch and are cooking all the time for someone!

The cost for this unit was significantly higher than what I had expected to spend; so I spent time reading the reviews to find out why others had spent their money on this appliance.  Finally, I took the risk and ordered it -- a wise and good decision.<br /><br />Some of the reviews complain about the foot print of the Breville but it really isn't all that much bigger than what I had before.  If your kitchen counter space is limited, I would still recommend this appliance.  I use mine to toast a half bagel in the morning, to bake egg rolls for lunch, and for pizza and small roasts for dinner.  It performs very well.  Because it is smaller than the oven in my stove, I would like to think it uses less energy for pizzas and roasts but I have no data to support that.  It also has other settings (bake, cookies, etc.) which I have not tried.<br /><br />The instruction booklet is thorough but poorly organized (the page headings are out of sync with the text).

We bought the BOV800XL about three years ago since it looked like one of the best, and we were tired of replacing cheap ovens every 2-3 years. The unit functioned well for about a year then the upper heating elements went out. We were just out of warranty but Breville said they would replace it, which was nice. The new Oven worked fine for about a year but the controls became very \\""sloppy\\"" not always doing what they should on the first try. The start/cancel button which sees the most use got worse and worse to the point of needing to be pushed 8-10 times to start the oven. This time around Breville was not going to help with repair. Since we liked the oven early on we recommended it to others, two people we know also bought units. One lost heating elements when it was about two years old, its now in landfill, the other is still going but the display lights flicker on and off randomly and the controls are getting sloppy. Its a shame such poor components are used in what should be a very nice oven, I would expect at least 10 years of use out of something like this.

I wanted a counter top oven for two reasons: 1) for family dinners when I need two ovens going at the same time and 2) I do a lot of baking for people and often need the use of more than one oven at a time.<br /><br />I've had this oven for about three weeks and have baked sheet cakes, home made biscuits, chicken, brats (the sausage, not kids), cookies, brownies and casseroles.  I'm on a slight learning curve for convection cooking but so far everything has turned out just fine.  It is limited in the size of pans and casserole dishes that can be used in this oven but most cooks have 9x13 or 9x9 baking pans and casserole dishes.<br /><br />If you're looking for an oven to cook frozen pizza or toast, this would be a little pricy and probably more than what you need; but if you're looking for a second oven for real cooking consider this one.",2013-02-07

Toasting takes a little bit more time than a regular toaster but it evenly toasts the bread and bagels and tastes good with a crunchy outside and soft inside.  The pizza tastes better than when I made it in my previous toaster oven.  I liked throwing a small pan of 2 pork chops in here instead of using a regular size oven.  I will be using this toaster oven for anything that will fit in here!  The top does get very hot so I did buy the Breville cutting board that fits perfect on top.",2013-02-07

So, I'll just add in the bits that make me particularly love this toaster oven:<br /><br />1. Great size & quick heating - this little oven can fit more in it than you'd think. I find that my use of the real oven has been cut in half (at least, probably more...) since we started using this toaster oven. It heats very evenly as well. I use ceramic, glass, metal, and even parchment overwrapped with foil in it when reheating food - all nicely but especially my ceramic pans. If I knew someone moving into a studio without an oven I'd strongly recommend this one - you can essentially cook just about anything in it - even a small to average sized whole chicken! (Ok, by whole, I mean the usual 'whole' you'd buy in the store - not a chicken with feathers, feet and a head. Since I have backyard chickens and have posted on chicken related products I figure I really ought to clarify so I don't horrify any fellow backyard chicken folks....)<br /><br />2. Has multiple settings - there is a toast, a roast, a bake, etc. The nice thing about the roast and bake - we keep it always on convection, so it makes roast and bake pretty much the same. Because of this, we leave the bake setting on 12 minutes at 410 degrees - we've found that most things we cook or reheat want about that range of time and temp, as well as things we heat from the fridge. With the bake setting always here, our daughter can stick things in to warm up and not worry about how to set it. She knows how to use toast and bake and we leave those two settings pretty much always the same so she can heat things on her own (she's 8).<br /><br />3. Kinda kid friendly - read #2 above about leaving some settings at a set time and temp for ease of use for kids. The downside is that they need to be cautious enough to wear an oven mitt to remove things after they've cooked - the oven is pretty hot and even the outside of it can be hot, so the glove is really needed to protect from burns. If your kid is forgetful or doesn't follow instructions well it could be a hazard, but so would any oven. We don't use a microwave, so for us this is great.<br /><br />4. love the bottom slide out tray - I'm one of those naughty people who butter their toast then stick it back in to melt, so there is always butter drips on the bottom. The tray slides out so easily I can wipe it down right after doing this, so no burnt butter on the bottom for the next person.<br /><br />We've had ours for over a year now with no issues except *someone* (not me!) put some bread that was in plastic on top of it then used it to heat something up - the plastic melted and some stuck to the front of the glass door and has left a clear, think plastic melty mark on the door. Beware - don't let people put stuff on top! I now keep a few dishtowels and cloth napkins on top which dissuades people putting other things up there (and also gives you a warm cloth if you need it - don't know why you'd need it but it's kinda cozy having warm dishtowels...)<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Positive -<br /><br />Heats quickly<br />Fits more than you'd think<br />Settings stay where you leave them<br />Simple to use - even for kids<br />Easy to clean, great drip tray<br /><br />Negative -  even the outside heats up, so beware of touching it or leaving things that can melt on it.<br /><br />It's worth the extra $$$ over your basic toaster ovens in my opinion.side of it can be hot, so the glove is really needed to protect from burns.

It is more expensive than most of the toaster ovens on the market but, you do get what you pay for in this instance.  I decided to be patient, save a little longer and get the best.  I have had the oven for 2 months and have used my regular oven only once in that time frame.  I have used the Breville for pizzas (frozen and fresh), cakes (9 x 13), meats, snacks, and toast and everything turns out beautifully - bakes to perfection!  If you are on the fence about this oven, I did the research, there is not a better one on the market!  I also ordered the crisper pan and the cutting board for the top of the oven.  The crisper pan does a perfect job on pizza crust - great purchase.  The cutting board is made to fit this oven and is a very well made and sturdy cutting board.

Not very practical.<br /><br />Expensive for just reheating. I am going to try a Cornish hen. Hopefully it's small size will help in avoiding over cooked outside edges.

Apparently there is an engineering or manufacture defect that many have noticed in which the unit just ups and dies without any warning. They will replace with a refurbished model even if warranty has expired because apparently this is a common problem with lots of angry folk.<br /><br />Read to see: [...]<br /><br />The  two big problems I had with oven have been fixed in current update, I notice.<br /><br />----<br /><br />Original post:<br /><br />One moment it worked. Twenty seconds later it just totally died.  Cooked well enough when I had. I'm a foodie and forgot about the convection feature after a few weeks. It is ridiculously unuseful with such a small oven.<br /><br />It was generally a decent toaster oven, though.  I rarely used the extra pizza space so it basically just took up that  extra counter space.<br /><br />(FIXED) Also I did not like the fact that it was not always easy to tell when it was turned on, as an additional dial had to be pushed after you set the temperature. When you set the temperature a bright blue led lit up the screen giving the false impression it was turned on. This false impression continued even two weeks ago before it died, as my partner still forgot to turn the oven on. This unfortunately is a Breville issue as I also face it with my Breville tea kettle, which also requires an additional start button, even though it also lights up blue after you set the temperature. Really very annoying as I've never had this issue with other appliances.<br /><br />(FIXED) I also did burn myself several times reaching in to pull the tray out and retrieve food. I really like the  toaster ovens that have a latch that automatically slides the tray out when you open the door. Basically it really sucks when you have pushed something in too far so that the dish is lying in the extended pizza section and you have to reach in extra deep and hope you don't get burned going in or coming out.<br /><br />I guess when I think about it I really didn't like this oven much. Other than looking really pretty it was a pain in the butt for the most part- a high price one at that.<br /><br />IMPORTANT UPDATE:<br /><br />This can be returned for a refurbished model AFTER the one year warranty expires by calling Breville if it totally dies without any warning.  Imagine when a circuit breaker just turns everything off without power. Only this oven never turns on again. There is an engineering defect with this product. I asked Breville Customer Service if they have found out what the problem was so I won't be facing this issue again soon as others have. The customer service person says this is not a big problem because she knows people who have had this oven work for a few years. I don't know how reassuring that is or how long this model has been out. I, however, know I've had toaster ovens that lasted a decade and were only replaced because I wanted something snazzier.  Basically- if out of warranty they will send you a refurbished oven with a warranty for 6 months and then good riddance. This is still much better than nothing as I can plan better plan for the next oven by someone else next time this just dies on me.<br /><br />My two major complaints have been addressed in the current model.<br /><br />1. It now has a latch that automatically slides out tray when door is open. Great for not burning hands.<br /><br />2. It has two different LED colored lights now so you can know when you are adjusting the dial the screen is blue (which doesn't matter) but a DIFFERENT color (orange)  so you can tell when the oven is actually turned on -  and this really matters-.

It ended up costing me less elsewhere, so thanks seller on Amazon!  Now the product is absolutely EXCELLENT!  I have used it for pork roasts, frozen bean burritos, reheating leftover delivery pizza that we had frozen, store bought frozen pizza, toast, and frozen breaded seafood!  My sister has a Nuwave oven, but I'm so glad I got this instead.  IT is stylish, unbelievably easy to clean and the cooking options are wonderfully varied!  It has inspired me to learn how to make my own pizza dough soon.  I haven't used any of the pans that came with it yet. I purchased inexpensive glass bakeware and a 13-inch pizza stone that was about 20 dollars cheaper than Breville's and it works great for pizza and other frozen items.  I'll be trying casseroles, cookies and muffins next.  Let me tell you the frozen bean burritos were crispy as if they had been fried. I did spray the pan and the burritos with \\""Pam.\\""  It makes me think that baked \\""fried\\"" chicken ought to turn out just as crunchy & delish. I caution you though, this oven seriously heats up the food.  I burned my lip on the beans in the burritos because I bit into it before letting it rest a few minutes after pulling out of the oven. I did purchase the cutting board for the top and it is a nice safety attachment to store pans on top of when not in use.  This has changed my view on cooking because I don't have to heat up the big oven or microwave as much.  I'll bet baked apples will be tasty quick or pies. This will become your most favorite appliance in the kitchen.

Everyone who commented on what it can do that other toaster ovens can't convinced us that this should be the replacement for our dying 15 year-old toaster oven.  Have had it only three days, so don't have a ton of results to report, but what it does, it does really well.  Baked potatoes, cookies and toast have all come out perfect!  Our homemade bread, toasted on \\""7,\\"" was an even golden brown on both sides.  On \\""5\\"" the toast was just beginning to crisp on the surfaces.  We like that the heating elements are controlled separately; we also like the convection and \\""frozen food\\"" features.  We like that the backlight on the display goes out after a few minutes.  We would love to have the option to turn the beep volume down or off (especially when the Midnight Walker gets a hankering for toast in the middle of the night).  The instruction book warns that the exterior gets hot - but with its cutting board in place, the top of the cutting board stayed at room temp.  I put the butter dish there (it's winter here), and the butter didn't even soften during all the tests I described above.  This was packed incredibly well at the factory, and then again for shipping.<br /><br />Update: A week later, we have tried more of the functions.  We're thrilled with everything we've tried.  Pizza is a standout.  Instead of 30-45 mins to reheat frozen pizza in our wall oven, this does a DiGiorno pizza in 15 minutes.  That's a huge energy savings, and one of the reasons we were interested in the Smart Oven.  If I could give it more stars, I would.  This has to be my best Amazon purchase ever.<br /><br />Update: Two months later, attempting to bake cookies, as I pressed the \\""Start\\"" button, I heard a little \\""pop.\\""  The LCD panel continued to work as if the oven were working, but in fact, the LCD is the only part of the oven that does work.

After two years I suffered the same problem as many others have reported: the LED display panel went out and it was very hard to use.  I put up with it for a few months then, three weeks ago, decided I would have to buy a new oven.  I didn't want to invest another $250 in a Breville in case the same problem occurred, so I bought a Calphalon (which is a very nice oven, but no match for the Breville).  Two weeks ago, I emailed Breville to ask if they would tell me how much it would cost to have the Smart Oven repaired, if that was possible.  To my amazement, I heard back immediately from one of their customer service people, Matt, who told me that even though my oven was long out of warranty, Breville would send me a certified re-built oven free of charge!  I boxed up my old oven and sent it back (using a pre-paid FedEx label conveniently provided by Matt) and within two days of its arrival at Breville on the East Coast I had an oven with a new display, accompanied by the accessories.  I am totally blown away by Breville customer service!  I know several people have complained about poor customer service on this forum (and I don't doubt the veracity of their comments) but I have nothing but great things to say.  The Calphalon oven is now in my daughter's kitchen (and she loves it!) and I am back to cooking with the Rolls Royce of toaster ovens -- so we're all happy.

I love heated plates and the top surface doubles as a plate warmer.  The crumb tray isn't the afterthought that it is on most toaster ovens - it's convenient and easy to clean after every use.

Some WD40 helped, but I have to wonder about the design of the mechanism.<br /><br />After two years, the fan started making a rattling noise.  Within a week of that, the fan stopped spinning entirely.  The reason?  The tiny nut that locks the fan to the shaft of the fan motor had worked itself loose, and the fan was wobbling and shifting on the shaft, causing it to come into contact with the fan housing.  Because the fan assembly is buried inside the oven housing, it is impossible to fix this problem without completely disassembling the oven.  Looking online, I discovered that this (among other things) was an extremely common problem with this oven.<br /><br />This all adds up to poor design and poor assembly.  I had a Delonghi for more than 5 years before I bought this oven.  The Delonghi cost 1/3 what this one did, and is now back on my kitchen counter in place of this overpriced engineering failure.  This oven is pretty, but in my opinion, is not designed or built last.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy another brand.<br /><br />Update:  I contacted Breville about my oven.  They replied that they would replace it.  Although originally told I would get a brand new one, I was in fact given the remanufactured version with the 90-day warranty.  They were very quick with the replacement, and so far (about three weeks), it is working like a new oven.  I will try to update again in a few months.  It was clear that Breville knows they had some issues with this model, and that they are trying to make amends.  Whether they have significantly changed or improved the design/assembly of newly manufactured units, I do not know.  I can only hope that I do not have any of the other issues (like the LCD failing) that I have read about in other reviews.",2013-01-19

I was thinking about buying another Cuisinart, but after a lot of research, I decided to go with the Breville Smart Oven. Wow, am I glad I did. Yes, it does cost a little more, but it does a better job than the Cuisinart. The Breville retails for $299, but I got it for $192 on Amazon (the Cuisinart retails at $179).<br /><br />For a comparison of the two ovens, I heated some frozen garlic bread in the Cuisinart for the specified time and it was still soft. I had to broil it for a couple of minutes and it still wasn't browned and crispy. With the Breville oven, I heated the same frozen garlic bread and after the specified time, the bread was browned and crispy. I was amazed! The texture was perfect. Even frozen french fries come out crispy and don't taste weird. I have always had to fry them because of that reason. Toast browns nicely; it even has a bagel setting so that you are mostly toasting the top. Everything that I have baked in it comes out perfectly.<br /><br />Another bonus is that the Breville has the crumb tray in the front of the oven; the Cuisinart's tray is in the back of the oven, making it difficult to empty since mine is in a tight spot on a shelf. The Breville is 1800 watts, while the Cuisinart is 1500 watts. More power!",2013-01-19

My 5 star review will mingle in all the other 5 star reviews because this oven is that good. It makes toast as picture perfect as you'll see - moist on the inside and snappy on the outside. But that's just the beginning. The mixed sourcing of heat is a major feature that let's me use the oven in place of the stove or the microwave when I make larger dinners. Pizzas for the kids are a breeze. The morning time with pre-cooked waffles and pancakes (our own healthy) recipes is such a time saver for my wife in getting them fed with good food before school. Roasting smaller things for our family of 4 like pork loins or turkey/chicken breasts saves a lot of time vs. doing it in the oven. I bought this about a month ago and fell in love. Then I saw last weekend that it got the Best Toaster Oven vote from Cook's Illustrated as well.<br /><br />UPDATE: This thing is great and is the workhorse of our family's food prep process. It is still going strong without one single problem except for a slight metal expansion pop while heating up - LOL! This thing can do almost everything.

It arrived from Amazon in a very timely manner.  It is lightweight and very easy to move, if you decide to located it in a different spot, or clean the counters.  One of the main concerns has been addressed.  Several reviewers mentioned that the crumb tray was only accessible from the back.  Now THE CRUMB TRAY IS EASILY REMOVED FROM THE LOWER FRONT!!  Great design change.  We were so excited to try this, as I had just purchase the  KITCHENAID PRO LINE SERIES WAFFLE BAKER as a Christmas gift for my husband and LOVE IT!  But when I tried to warm the waffles, they are so HUGE and thick, that I wasn't able to use my toaster and didn't want to heat up the large oven.  (Granted I could place them into the waffle iron, itself, as it recommends for one reheating idea, but my husband said we should invest in a toaster oven, because it would be easier for him to use, and had many other uses, as well.<br /><br />WELL, I am excited to report that it is just wonderful!  It reheated the waffles so that they were moist inside and very crispy outside.  Just absolutely perfect!<br /><br />We haven't tried other functions as yet, but only got it yesterday!<br /><br />One thing you do need to be aware of, and it DOES say this in the product information.  The top is a warming tray (I put a glass dish of butter on top, and it was soft/melted-ready for the waffles!).  The sides and top and back DO get untouchably hot.  The handle stays cool.  But, care is needed during the time the oven is in use, and during the cooling, because I can see where a child or hurried adult might get burned, if not very careful.<br /><br />It also must be well ventilated.  It states that it should not be enclosed in a cabinet or too close (at least 4 inches away) from surrounding items.  We placed ours on the top of a bar that overlooks our counter area.  The back is fully enclosed, so no 'ugly' or dangerous wires or other 'inner workings' are visible from the back.<br /><br />I guess the bottom line is this.  I don't think I have ever been more please with something I purchased.  It has performed exactly as described.  Well, I guess I need to amend that.  I am equally pleased with the Waffle Baker I mentioned above!  :)<br /><br />Hope this helps with decisions.

It has replaced my pop-up toaster, my toaster oven, and it often substitutes for the microwave and the full-size oven. I have used it for toast, pizza (frozen and fresh from scratch), roasting meats and vegetables, pie crusts, and reheating all kinds of food. Nothing works better.<br /><br />I have tried all kinds of toasters, from the cheapest you can get to the expensive Kitchenaid models (the latter of which lasted barely two years). The Breville does better with anything I throw at it - all kinds of bread, bagels, and even frozen waffles. It is the only thing I have found that browns evenly and consistently, no matter how dark or light you set it and no matter how many slices you put in it.<br /><br />The oven is big enough for six slices of toast, a 12-inch pizza, a pie, or a small chicken. I could use more room if it was available, but perhaps the technology does not scale any larger. (I wish my full-size oven worked this well.) As a convection oven, I was somewhat surprised that it did not come with multiple racks, say for cooking more than one sheet of cookies at a time. But again, perhaps that is a limitation of the technology.<br /><br />My one real complaint is that it makes my kitchen lights flicker, enough that I turn them off when using this oven (we get enough spill-over light from other rooms so I can still see to cook). I think it may be some sort of RF interference rather than the load on the circuit. It doesn't happen in all modes (for example, there is no flickering when toasting), and the effect is more or less pronounced with different types of bulbs.",2013-01-11

It also seems very easy and intuitive to use. Time will tell how well it performs. However, just a few notes about placement on your countertop. These comments are based on the burn-in process that Breville suggests to cook off manufacturing residue.<br /><br />The left side, rear and top of the unit get extremely hot (touching will burn you) so I would guess that you need adequate clearance (3-4\\"" minimum) all around when considering placement. The manual makes reference to the hot top but I did not se anything about the rear and sides as well as required clearance. Also, while the AC plug is formed with a clever finger hole for pulling from a socket, it also makes the plug longer such that it can interefere with oven positioning depending on where your wall outlet is.

Rather than post a 300 word review, go to Breville and download the manual in PDF if your interested. This is a great item for the kitchen.<br />We only use our wall oven for larger pots and pans... But for two people or for an apartment or dorm room, this is the ticket.",2013-01-10

Wish I'd purchased years ago!","I've only had it for a week, but it's awesome so far.  I live in NYC, so have a relatively small space, so keep all of my big pans in my oven.  This makes using the oven a chore (take everything out, put it on the already limited counter space), especially just to cook my 2 year old 1 chicken tender.<br />I finally broke down and got this model.<br /><br />It's so great, and I love the features so far (have yet to even begin to use them all).<br /><br />It heats up super quickly (to high heats, like 425 on Bake, it probably takes 5-6 minutes).<br /><br />It beeps when it's ready.<br /><br />The timer count down starts.<br /><br />It beeps when it's done, and turns off.<br /><br />The food is perfect (using the cooking directions of the food).<br /><br />I've tried cookies, chicken and toast so far, and all have been perfect.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, it also saves your last setting.  So my son's chicken cooks for 13 minutes at 425.  Not like it's hard to set this (it takes like 4 seconds), but if that's the last setting on Bake that I used, all I do is press start.<br /><br />My minor annoyances:<br />The plug that I need to plug it into happens to be right behind the unit.  The unit's plug is stiff and about 2 inches.  Which means I have to leave it pulled out from the back of the counter by 2 inches.  It'd be much nicer if it sat flush to the back of the counter.  Of course, this is only because of my plug position...<br /><br />I haven't found out how to leave the grated toast tray in (which pops out when you open the door, which is really nice) and put the baking tray in below it in a convenient way.  So I'm just putting the baking tray on top of the grated toast thing. It works fine.<br /><br />Definitely a great buy if you're lazy like me/don't want to heat an entire oven for 1 cookie!",2013-01-09

We really wanted to upgrade our ancient toaster oven but there were so many choices out there so it took some time before we decided on this one. We did a lot of research and review reading and kept coming back to this one, so we decided to buy it and we loved it from day one. Thanks to this little guy, we hardly use the regular oven anymore, unless we need to bake up a large batch of cookies or roast a turkey. This oven may be on the pricier side, but my husband and I try to limit splurges on items that will really make a useful impact on our daily lives, and this item definitely has. It even got me to eat breakfast more frequently. :) Because it's much smaller than our regular oven, it preheats very quickly and uses less energy, so no longer feel guilty for baking or reheating items in small quantities anymore. It takes up less counter space than our microwave, but it can accommodate a 9x13\\"" baking pan (albeit just barely). One of our favorite quick meals/snacks to make is flatbread pizza, and the 13\\"" pizza pan is the perfect size for it.<br /><br />The large lcd display is very nice (we like the light blue) and all of the pertinent info is organized logically. The options (function/temp/time) are very easy to select or change with the dials. When the desired oven temp has been reached, the timer automatically starts. When the timer is done, the oven automatically shuts off. Although the auto count-down is a great feature, it would have been nice to have the option to manually start the timer once the desired temp has been reached. I guess the manufacturer omitted this option to prevent unnecessary prolonged heating, in case the user forgets to turn it off. The time range is between 1 min-2 hrs, so if you want to cook something longer, you will have to keep an eye on it and manually increase the time. Bread and bagels come out toasted much better than they ever did in our pop up toaster and it's nice to have separate settings for each. I don't mind that there is no oven light, as it eliminates the need to get a replacement bulb down the line. I just keep a mini flashlight in the kitchen drawer in the event that I need to take a peek at the food. The oven is very easy to clean and keep clean, especially because of the pull out crumb tray.<br /><br />Overall, this oven has been well worth the investment, is both well designed and fully functional, takes up minimal counter space, and is perfect for smaller households.

Over the years I've owned 4 different toaster ovens and have been disappointed with each and every one.  Now granted, this is larger and more expensive than a regular toaster oven, but it's worth if for the additional benefits.  First of all, it toasts to perfection.  You select the number of slices(up to 6) that you're toasting and then it adjusts the heat to the appropriate level to toast perfectly.  Want to broil something?  No problem, move the rack up a level and choose the broiling temperature and you're all set.  Need to bake a small batch of cookies or an appetizer?  Okay...done.  The convection makes things faster, the small size keeps you from heating your full size oven for a small item and because of the size, it obviously heats up much faster.  Make sure you have the counter space because it's pretty big, but once I cleared the space, it's been used everyday since I got it.

I got this oven for Christmas.  It is solidly built and came with useful accessories.  It is a good deal more attractive than my previous oven whose paint wore off after about 2 months.<br /><br />The size is larger than most toaster ovens, although it still fits well on the counter top.  I like it that, after the toast is done and buttered, the whole plate will fit into the still warm oven while the eggs finish.  I routinely make toast in it, and, once I figured out the perfect setting, it is perfect every time.  I have baked a few things in it, and, while I haven't checked with an oven thermometer, the baked goods come out well.<br /><br />A tray catches the crumbs and pulls out for washing.  Since my main oven is self cleaning, I doubt I will use this for anything that splatters - such as bacon.<br /><br />When the rack is in the middle, the shelf pulls part way out automatically by means of a magnet, a convenience.<br /><br />I have read that the customer service is bad, and I read one very disturbing review by someone who had the glass door shatter.

US,49672034,RUEKONWU2GNHW,B001L5TVGW,608011455,Breville BOV800XL Smart Oven 1800-Watt Convection Toaster Oven with Element IQ,Kitchen,4.0,1.0,1.0,N,N,"3 years of perfect cooking, still going strong","As you'll read in other reviews, the all steel, vented design requires a good deal of unobstructed counter space.<br />Operation is quiet and pleasant even with the convection fan running, and the preheat/done ringer is set at a reasonable volume. At 1800 watts, I'm careful not to invoke the 500 degree broil setting unless I have to, there are other devices on my 15 amp circuit.<br /><br />Preheating is so fast, it seems a waste of heat and electricity to open the oven door. So I tested cold-start baking with a raisin bran muffin recipe. I put a filled muffin pan on the bottom rack of the oven, chose CONVECTION BAKE at 400 degrees, and 17 minutes later-including the fast preheating time-I was enjoying crusty brown muffins, light and moist inside. A slightly lower temp setting might have worked just as well and finished just a few minutes later. This technique obviously won't work with broiling or searing meats, of course.<br /><br />As for toast and bagels, I like golden brown, and that means a setting of 6 to 7 on the toast and bagel range. The Breville doesn't seem to have a truly dark brown setting, but it sure does a great job of uniform browning. Frozen french fries and fish sticks, burritos, pizzas, all come out surprisingly well using this oven. It's also great for melting cheese or browning the top of a dish.<br /><br />Large, thick ceramic covered casseroles with high sides seem to confuse the thermostat and impede the convection process. The manual recommends metal pans and containers, and so far they've yielded the best results.<br /><br />Toasting results vary based on the thickness and moistness of breads. You'll find yourself experimenting with the settings. It's easy to reset the Element IQ memory if you've made a few timing mistakes: unplug the unit for about 5 seconds, then plug it back in and it's factory fresh.<br />My main wish would be for an advanced programming routine that could begin at one temperature or setting and end at another--for roasts, casseroles, etc.<br /><br />It's now three years since I bought the Breville. The crumb tray and wire rack look a bit worse for wear--I found an online depot in Utah that has cheap replacement parts, and they're now on order. If anything, the oven's performance has improved--not sure how, perhaps the radiant elements needed break-in time. I would give 4 1/2 stars if I could here.<br />I'd gladly recommend this oven to anyone looking for excellent cooking performance in a countertop unit.e I bought the Breville.

After bringing it back to the store, I reviewed toaster ovens online and found this Breville Smart Oven and read great reviews here on Amazon. I received my new toy in two days with Amazon Prime and it was so simple to set up.<br /><br />Yes, the top gets hot as some have said, but not as hot as the countertop oven I had just returned. I believe this is a common occurrence with toaster ovens since they ARE ovens. Ovens get hot where the heat is released too.<br /><br />The Breville was so easy to set up and get going with. And it toasts great! My pizzas turned out wonderfully in much less time than in the regular oven. The convection setting gives a nice crisp crust, but you can cook without the convection if you choose to. You can choose how many slices of bread you are putting in and how light or dark you wanted your toast. It has a bagel setting that toasts bagels differently than toast: brown on top, warmed on bottom. You can, of course, use the toast setting instead and brown on both sides.<br /><br />I love how there are so many preset settings, yet they are all so easy to change to your own preferences.

Over the years, I've owned a DeLonghi Convect/Toaster oven, and a couple of Cuisinart Convect/Toaster ovens. I gave my last Cuisinart to  a family member when I got the Breville, and it still works.<br /><br />For a year & a half I have sung the praises of my Smart Oven. Love it. But, a mere 6 months past it's warranty, I got an E01 error. I unplug, replug, fine. A week to 10 days later, another E01 error. The manual says to call an 800 number. Online it says \\"" . . . we would be unable to troubleshoot and resolve with your unit and would need replacement under warranty to fix the issue.\\"" Even though I was 6 months out of the 1 year warranty, I called anyway, because I found out online this is a common problem - even with NEW ovens! Yikes!!<br /><br />They would replace it with a re-manufactured oven only. No thank you!<br /><br />This oven is in a secure location - no water, no other appliances on the plug, nothing on top but the Breville Bamboo cutting board designed to fit on the oven. I was given no explanation for the error; just that it is not fixable. So, after only 18 months of spending $250 for an oven that I expected to last at least 10 years, I'm stuck with an oven that appears to have some sort of manufacturing error.<br /><br />What a shame for an otherwise well functioning oven.<br /><br />UPDATE: July 2014: My Breville Smart Oven is still working fine, I still use it everyday for lots of different things, and I am thrilled that it still performs well - cooks evenly and easily. It cooks better than any counter top convection oven I've owned (Delonghi & Cuisinart). I've gotten the error message a few times a year and it always resets and runs fine after being unplugged and plugged back in.

Grossly Overpriced,"I was sufficiently interested in the reviews on Amazon to buy one of these things even though I don't really need it.  I was just plain curious and thought I might have use for this thing in a second business house I use for a few days each month.  What you actually get is an OK, seemingly heavy but flimsy at the same time, highly automated toaster oven.  Sure, there are a few interesting design features, but if you are expecting this thing to change your life, you are surely kidding yourself.<br /><br />Anyone who has any competency at cooking or baking is apt to find the automated features to be a poor excuse for their own judgment when it comes to the time and temperature choices this automated toaster oven will make for you.  If you are looking for the \\""ultimate\\"" in reheated food or frozen pizza preparation than you either have very low expectations, no taste, or both.  If you can't figure out how long to preheat a toaster oven than maybe this product will help you, but hopefully most of you could figure that out for yourselves.<br /><br />Granted, this thing can substitute for a large built in oven for many people, as can ANY acceptable and appropriately sized countertop oven.  The included cheaply made accessories would not sell for even $10 in total at your local Walmart.<br /><br />Basically, what you have here is a toaster oven that is ridiculously overpriced for what it is, because it has a few dubious electronic and automated features that most people could figure out for themselves and probably do better with a much cheaper oven.  The bread toasting function is pretty mediocre compared to most any toaster, but you could say that about most toaster ovens.  There is no magic here.<br /><br />If you want a reasonably priced toaster oven that is capable of doing most everything that this product can do, at a much lower price, you have many choices out there, and reading the online reviews you could probably expect that most of the cheaper competition will last longer in actual use.  If what you really want is a rugged and durable commercial tabletop oven, this Breville is NOT it; you have many choices from several hundred dollars on up well past $1000.00.  For example, I have owned a couple of Sodir/Equipex ovens that fit that description (FC26/FC33/FC34) and in no way is this Breville comparable in design, durability, or execution.  There are also a number of other manufacturers in the commercial/catering tabletop oven niche.  The Breville is clearly a toy in comparison to a real commercial or catering product.<br /><br />My suggestion would be to either get something a LOT cheaper, or a lot more expensive, but I do not understand the fuss being made about this product, nor can I recommend it based on my own experience or in comparison to many other products in this category that I have personally used.st longer in actual use.

But keep in mind a few things before ordering...<br /><br />The Breville takes up roughly the footprint of a small microwave and, like any toaster or toaster oven, gets hot to the touch to the point you can burn yourself around most of its surface.  But this is WAY more surface space than your typical toaster or toaster oven, so you may want to take that into consideration if you have small children or even pets.  It requires ventilation space too, so concealed areas are not an option here.  And if you already have a convection oven or microwave (or want to consider replacing either standard unit in your home), you may as well just buy an ordinary toaster.<br /><br />But if you have the space and no desire to replace your standard microwave or range, this is one sexy looking hunk-o-junk in your kitchen.<br /><br />Read the (very intimidating looking) instruction manual for setup, particularly the part about running it before using it.  Step-by-step instructions on the different cooking modes are simple enough and will tell you what you need to know to understand the functionality pretty quickly.  There are several preset modes for different food types that automatically set everything but which won't necessarily match the instructions for your specific food item.  Once you manually adjust these modes, the Breville remembers your changes and automatically applies them next time you use that mode.  So if you eat the same frozen pizza all the time, set the temp and time in \\""Pizza\\"" mode once and you won't have to adjust it again.<br /><br />Once you get going, this is easy to use and produces great results.  Convection cooking, like standard oven baking, uses heat elements.  The difference is that a fan is incorporated to rotate the air and provide more even cooking.  You save time and energy here in that preheating takes less time (about five minutes for 400 degrees) and in some cases, food cooks more quickly.  The negative?  There's fan noise.  It's not as loud as a microwave...about half the volume, I'd say...but it's there.  Another quirk is that the cooking timer immediately starts counting down once preheating is complete, so if you are allowing the oven to preheat while you're doing something else and don't insert the food for a few minutes after preheating is complete, you'll need to re-adjust the cooking time.<br /><br />In my use of the convection mode, I've cooked a frozen 12-inch pizza (Walmart's \\""World Table\\"" brand pepperoni and fresh mozzarella), some pizza rolls, and some cookies (Otis Spunkmeyer from frozen dough).  All of them cooked perfectly using the food manufacturer's temperature and time settings.  Very even cooking all around.  The cookies were top-to-bottom some of the most perfectly cooked I've ever seen.<br /><br />Toast worked great too, though this actually takes longer to perform toasting than a normal toaster (about 5 minutes).  But the unit can toast like six pieces of bread at one time, so there's that.  I don't normally make toast, but I do toast hamburger and hot dog buns.  I like that I can see the buns in the big window and visually tell when they're just starting to brown.<br /><br />So if you've got the space and tend to bake in small batches, this is a great tool you'll find yourself using over your standard oven a lot.  But if you have a convection oven function in your existing range or microwave, this is basically overkill.minutes for 400 degrees) and in some cases, food cooks more quickly.  The negative?

I wasn't too interested until she pointed out that it was a convection oven, just like our full size Electrolux, which I love. So, thinking that even if it wasn't perfect it'd probably make a decent warming oven, I went ahead and bought it. Except for it's size, this oven is pretty much as capable as any full size oven I've ever worked with!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Easy to operate. The little LCD screen is easy to read from both a visual sense and an understanding sense. Everything you need to know is right there laid out in an easy to understand way. Whether you're making toast or cookies, snacks or a full meal, it's easy to set the oven to what you want. Additionally, the back light of the display is red/orange when cooking and blue when not, so it's easy to tell that too.<br /><br />- Cooks pretty much everything perfectly. Toast comes out just right, as do biscuits, chicken, stuffing, cookies, cupcakes, pretty much anything you put in it. This really is like a full size oven reduced to counter top size.<br /><br />- Whoever designed the mechanism to pull out the rack when you open the front door should get a gold star. Two little magnets are in the door at the mid-level setting of the rack, which is where 95% of the time you'll have it. The magnets click on to the rack and pull it out about 3 or 4 inches when you open the door then, as the angle gets greater, they let go so you can open the door all the way. This is a brilliant piece of design with nothing to break and that will last the lifetime of the oven. It's a little thing, but it sure is handy.<br /><br />- Looks great. It's all stainless steel so, if like me, you've got stainless appliances in your kitchen, it'll fit right in and look really good on the counter. Even if you don't, it'll still look good. Even the dials have a nice chamfered edge to them that adds some class to the whole thing. A small thing, but it shows thought went into the ovens design. Overall, whole \\""look and feel\\"" of everything is well thought out.<br /><br />- Comes with a nice pizza tray, broiler, and baking tray. None are special but they didn't have to give them to you and they do anyway.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Takes up more room than a conventional toaster. This may seem obvious, but it's worth saying that you'll loose counter space over a traditional toaster with this. So, if all you want it toast, I'd recommend you do a search for \\""Cuisinart toaster\\"" and buy one of them - they're quite good.<br /><br />- Gets hot. Except when using this as a warming oven, this thing gets hot. Hot enough that the instruction manual tells you not to set anything within a couple of inches of it. The only things that don't get hot are the door handle and the controls. Everything else gets untouchable when baking. This is true of pretty much all the items like this, but just be aware of it.<br /><br />- I wish the timer alarm could be set to be a bit louder. It's plenty fine when you're in the same room, but walk a room or two away and you'll miss it.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this oven, while pretty much the most expensive toaster oven I've seen, is completely worth it if you're at all serious about cooking. I always discounted toaster ovens as what you bought when you lived in a dorm or you couldn't afford a \\""real\\"" oven, but this oven is very capable and a great complement to any kitchen.<br /><br />Update 8 Months later:<br />It's 8 months later and I still love this oven - the oven itself is flawless. Not so flawless is the 13\\"" round non-stick pan it came with. I really like the pan, but after 8 months of light use (for the pan), the non-stick bubbled and wiped right off during cleaning. It came off so easily, that I think there was a fair chance that if I'd just washed this in the dishwasher and then cooked on it again, the non-stick would have come off with the food. I'm not sure sure how bad ingesting this stuff would be, but I, for one, don't want to try it. So, my advice - buy the oven, but toss the pan and get something else.e was a fair chance that if I'd just washed this in the dishwasher and then cooked on it again, the non-stick would have come off with the food.

Almost everyone loves this product and when Amazon would sell these off as refurbished units, they would always sell out within minutes.  One day I got lucky and purchased 1 of the refurbished units, especially since every review I read said that it was the same as new.  I was a little excited to tell my spouse about this new replacement that was about to arrive.<br /><br />The day the package arrived, I got a call from my spouse and she said the unit looked to be pretty scratched up and she was having a problem getting it to work.  At first I'm thinking that it is just a matter of leaning how to operate the device so when I got home we set about looking it over.  Turns out it was totally defective.  I was very disappointed and telephoned Amazon to express my concerns.  The usual apology and return followed.  Amazon was great, full refund, paid shipping.  I also was concerned on reflection about why it seems that Amazon often had these refurbished units.  I mean for a product that has such great reviews, why so many refurbished units?<br /><br />I would say a year went by when a few weeks ago this same product was put on special at about the same price as a refurb unit.  I bit again, but this time for NEW.  It arrived, and no phone calls from the spouse.  I came home to find the item completely unpacked and my spouse had already put it to good use.  WOW.  I have to say, it is really nice, so FAR.  I hope it holds up.<br /><br />Now the best part of the story.  About a week later, Amazon lowered the price again by about $12.

Looks great, easy to use!","After reading many toaster oven reviews I decided to try the Breville.  It arrived yesterday in great shape and I've already experimented with a few dishes.  All went well but there will be a short learning curve with getting used to our first toaster oven in several years.  Our home is all electric and I grew tired of seeing so much electricity wasted with the large oven; our daughter using it for a few slices of garlic bread, for example.<br /><br />Some of the reviews here raised questions about temperature accuracy so I decided to test it so there would be no doubts.  I used a new Norpro oven thermometer sold here on Amazon and rated 5 stars.  All temps were done on the Bake setting and started at 350 with the Norpro sitting at the center of the rack in the middle position.  Here are the results:<br /><br />Set at 350 degrees, temperatures by the minutes:<br /><br />4 minutes:  250 and the chime sounded to indicate pre-heat was complete.  Temp was still steadily rising.<br />5 minutes:  300 degrees<br />6 minutes:  330 degrees<br />7 minutes:  340 degrees<br />8 minutes:  350 degrees<br />9 minutes:  355 degrees<br />10 minutes:  360, then held steady.<br /><br />So, it's true, the pre-heat chime does sound early, but with the temperature steadily climbing the oven will be near ready by the time you respond to the chime and get the dish in the oven.  Not an issue for me if it takes an extra minute or two to reach temp setting.<br /><br />Then I turned on the Convection fan and noted the temp dropped 10 degrees over the next couple of minutes, then remained steady.  This works well with the oven's actual temps being slightly warmer.  The convection fan provides a sufficient breeze to circulate the air well.<br /><br />I then tested other temps for accuracy.  For these tests I lowered the rack to the bottom position because it placed the thermometer's center/sensing coil at mid-height in the oven.  Here are settings followed by actual temperatures:<br /><br />250  250-255<br />300  300-305<br />400  405-410<br />450  455<br /><br />I did not test any higher or lower temperatures.<br /><br />I have to say, I'm impressed so far with everything about the Breville oven including the temperature accuracy.  Being a few degrees warmer is good in my opinion.<br /><br />The power cord is 3 feet long and originates 2 inches from the right rear of the oven.<br /><br />I also checked the outer surface temps by hand.  With oven at 450 I could hold my hand against the right side surface easily.  Left side for about 3 seconds.  Top...just long enough to know you don't want to touch it there.  There are vents near the top of each side and using an infra-red thermometer measured venting air around 150 degrees.<br /><br />I'll update this post if any issues come up but for now I'm quite pleased with the purchase.

But it was resting flat on the counter, and my counter is flat and level. I set the oven on two other flat table tops to confirm that it was the oven and not my counter. The oven's feet are not adjustable which means the entire oven is twisted or otherwise not square or assembled improperly, so it will not sit flat on all four feet. Which is ridiculous for a just-unboxed product.<br /><br />This reflects poorly on Breville's quality control, and i didn't even get to turn it on. So rather than living with an oven that wobbles or trying to rig some sort of solution to keep it level, i'm taking advantage of Amazon's generous return policy and have sent it back and requested a new replacement. The full review on this oven will have to wait. I just hope the replacement unit will sit still long enough for me to cook something in it.<br /><br />I've attached a video that shows the oven teetering across two of its feet while sitting on a flat surface.",2012-12-14

Let me start by saying that I do not own this brand but have an old Cuisinart convection toaster oven that is dying and I was interested in purchasing this unit. Therefore I read the bad as well as the good reviews. As a mechanical engineer something seemed strange about the huge temperature errors being reported here. I think there might be a problem with the way people are \\""testing\\"" this.<br /><br />Oven thermometers, especially the mechanical dial type, are very slow to respond to changes in the air temperature in the oven. There are very few \\""instant read\\"" oven thermometers and even these are sluggish at high temperatures taking 20 seconds or so to register a reading. Remember that toaster ovens are very small spaces and the air heats much more rapidly (it takes 3 to 4 minutes to get to 350deg F) than happens in a normal kitchen oven (15 to 20 minutes to get to 350 deg F). So if someone takes a Taylor thermometer designed for a normal oven and puts it in a toaster oven it may respond slower than the toaster oven air temperature and could read low until the thermometer reaches the actual oven temperature.<br /><br />I have a number of dial oven thermometers (mostly Taylor) and one mercury bulb. Putting them in my large conventional oven and then checking them at 4 minutes, they all read different. Checking again 10 minutes after the oven indicated temperature reached, they all read the same. I just put my commercial grade Taylor dial oven thermometer in my room temperature Cuisinart toaster oven and set it to convection for a target of 350 degs. F. When the oven signaled that the desired temperature was reached, the Taylor thermometer read 200 degs. F. This is the same \\""problem\\"" being discussed here and yet the Cuisinart cooks properly in the allotted time. I believe that the readers complaining about incorrect temperatures are probably not waiting long enough and are seeing the lag time in the thermometer which is not designed for quick response.<br /><br />I would appreciate it if any reviewer who posted about this problem and who waited a long time (10 to 15 minutes) before comparing readings of the unit dial and an oven thermometer would let us know as a large difference after a long time would indicate a true control error in the unit.<br /><br />Finally, this does not mean all the posters are wrong. If you are heating frozen dinners and they constantly come out cold after the required time there may be a problem.  However, proper usage of an oven of any type requires you to get the oven preheated before putting in the item to be cooked. Generally this means waiting 5 to 10 minutes after the oven heaters start their cycling on and off. With a toaster oven most people do not do this and therefore depending on the oven design may need to increase cook times.<br /><br />I would also note that in a toaster oven the convection feature is not as useful as in a large oven due to the small space (see Consumer Reports review in 2012). It would be most useful if you cook a lot of heavy items such as roasting chickens. Otherwise it does very little based on my experience with my Cuisinart unit. So you might want to consider the smaller and cheaper unit which does not have this (and eliminates the problematic fan noise also).ong enough and are seeing the lag time in the thermometer which is not designed for quick response.<br /><br />I would appreciate it if any reviewer who posted about this problem and who waited a long time (10 to 15 minutes) before comparing readings of the unit dial and an oven thermometer would let us know as a large difference after a long time would indicate a true control error in the unit.<br /><br />Finally, this does not mean all the posters are wrong.

I've used it several times a week since I got it last month (primarily for roasting and toasting) and have yet to be disappointed. It heats up much faster than my regular 20\\"" oven (we're talking about in a matter of minutes -- 3? 5? -- sometimes even before I've prepped the pan). I like the crisping effect of the convection on anything from sweet potato fries to roasted vegetables, and I do notice that it speeds up cooking times. I'm not much of a toast person, but the preset settings for toast did a perfect job of lightly browning my slider buns. I've also baked salmon, roasted chicken legs, and baked apples in this machine, which is far more than I ever dared to do in my $50 toaster oven. Even when the salmon spattered the inside of the glass door, it cleaned off easily, and I couldn't find much mess on the rest of the inside to clean off.<br /><br />The only things that didn't turn out perfectly were either operator error or a matter of me getting used to how this oven cooks; for example, I think I need to set the rack in the middle when I'm heating a thin layer of food (like my roasted butternut squash) because if the rack is on the bottom, it seems to brown the bottom of those foods too much. I alternate between liking the fact that the oven shuts off after your timer goes off (keeping me from burning things by accident) and getting frustrated with it when I'm cooking things that are unpredictable in how much time they need to cook, leading to repeated cycles of timer dinging, oven turning off, me checking and deciding to cook the food for longer, and me then messing up how to turn the oven back on (forgive me, it's new, I'm still getting used to it).<br /><br />I haven't encountered the problems that others have had with the rack sliding out too fast and dumping trays when it's set in the middle position (the position where opening the door causes the rack to slide out a few inches). Nor have I been terribly inconvenienced by the lack of an interior light. I've used foil in the oven without issues, just being careful to keep it from touching the heating elements (and the walls too, but I may just be overcautious). I think stainless steel does get water spots easily, so be careful with wiping the oven off quickly if you spill water on it.<br /><br />I love this gadget so much that I'm trying to convince my siblings, parents and sister-in-law get ones for themselves. I've already ordered the bamboo cutting board to go on top, and Breville may have suckered me into acquiring their Smart Grill next. The only thing I'm sad about is that I purchased my oven shortly before a high-end competitor ran a pre-Christmas promotional discount that Amazon matched. Still, I figure I used it plenty in the intervening weeks (including cooking for houseguests and a Thanksgiving potluck) and got my money's worth out of that extra time.

This oven does that, and much more.<br /><br />What is phenomenal about this toaster is the evenness of cooking and the control that you have. We still reheat pizza, yes, but we have the control to make the crust just the way we like it: barely warmed and soft (the kid's preference), slightly crunchy (the way I like it) or crunchy and evenly browned across the top (hubby's style). We no longer have the problem of the top burning before the bottom is cooked. Toast - and English muffins come out perfect.<br /><br />The problem with using regular toaster ovens for more than toasting has always been heat regulation. This oven does a fantastic job of heating evenly. I make lots of cookies for holidays, and was able to do it much faster this Thanksgiving by making batches in this oven and my regular oven at the same time. Those cookies came out just a nice as the ones from my regular oven.<br /><br />It's is versatile and dependable. Lots of functions to control it just the way you want it. With 6 people living in this house, this is a great second oven. If I was a couple living alone, I might find this all the oven I needed for most days.<br /><br />CONS (and they are small):<br />It's a little large, but we had the space.<br /><br />The pizza tray that comes with the oven needs work. Within two days, the finish was falling off. No one will confess, but I think the kids ran it though the dishwasher. Breville shipped me a new one immediately, and the whole family was told that this was a \\""hand wash\\"" item only. Since then, no problems. As a matter of fact, it is the most-used pan.<br /><br />Lastly, not a con, but a piece of advice. Make sure that you take advantage of that little convection button. Some things cook better with convection, and some cook better with it turned off. My preference? Cookies and baking - no convection. Pizza reheats, frozen french fries and other things you want slightly browned - convection on.ng - no convection.

I use it, quite literally, every single day. I toast, broil, bake and reheat things in it all the time. I have a tiny kitchen, with almost no counter space to speak of, and I don't regret giving up the space for this little oven one bit. It has the most powerful broiler in a toaster oven you can buy. It's easy to clean, looks great, and appears to be sturdily constructed for the most part.<br /><br />Now, on to the bad things:<br /><br />1. The convection fan developed a rattling noise. This is a known issue they've had with these ovens, and it requires you to send it back for warranty repair.  Unfortunately, mine developed the rattle after the warranty had expired, so I'm out of luck.  The fan and the oven still work fine, it's just the convection fan makes an annoying rattling sound when you use the convection feature.  It quiets down some after it gets fully heated up, but it's still there.  Doesn't seem to affect oven function though.<br /><br />2. LCD backlight random fails. This is another known issue. The backlight on the LCD display will randomly stop working. Again, this is a warranty repair that requires you to send your oven back, which means you're out of a toaster oven for 2 weeks. Unless you bake in a dark kitchen, this is a minor annoyance, but for as much as this costs, I should not be annoyed.<br /><br />3. The pizza pan they include is absolutely craptacular. The coating practically falls off after you use it twice.<br /><br />4. The biggest sin is that it just does not toast bread very well. I was expecting perfect toast for $200+. If my old Sunbeam automatic toaster was a 10/10, this is about a 6/10. Unfortunately, I don't have room on my counter for another appliance so I have to live with it. Thankfully, I don't make toast that often, so it's a small deal for  me, but if you make toast daily, then you might want to re-consider this product.<br /><br />If you are looking for a toaster oven to primarily make toast, then I highly recommend you instead take a good look at the Panasonic toaster oven, which makes absolutely perfect toast, but isn't quite a large or as versatile as the Breville is for cooking and baking [[ASIN:B008C9UFDI Panasonic NB-G110P Flash Xpress Toaster Oven, Silver]]<br /><br />So, in closing, I like the oven, I like the concept, I love the design, it just has some problems. But, you might get lucky and get a perfect one without a rattling fan or a bad display, or you might not. You might already have a good toaster, and just need a small oven. If that's the case, then this might just be for you.

After seeing so many other reviewers having a similar experience of units going dead between 3 months to 1.5 years I will not repurchase and will try another brand.<br /><br />If you are reading this looking to make a purchase decision, you are now forewarned.  Most of the favorable reviews reflect the reviewer's initial experience.  I was once in that blissful camp.<br /><br />Most of the low rated reviews have one thing in common ... units stop working.  Since the product has not been on the market all that long this indicates either a design longevity problem or the use of a marginal/defective component in its manufacture.<br /><br />Buy this item if you feel \\""lucky\\"".<br />Good luck!<br /><br />Update -- two days later 12/6/12<br />I have revised my review of two days ago from one-star to four stars.  Why?  Upon my contact through Breville's online support site yesterday they readily offered to replace the oven with a remanufactured unit - even though it was well beyond its warranty.  I have to admire a company that is willing to correct its product faults beyond the written warranty to achieve customer satisfaction. Feeling luckier, I presume the replacement unit is properly improved and write this updated review in appreciation of good Breville customer service.<br /><br />I also notice that the selling price has now dropped 20% over the past two days.  The combination of strong product support by Breville and a more attractive price on Amazon makes this a a terrific buy.",2012-12-04

Prior to ordering this oven we were using a Cuisinart toaster oven for about 6 years.  For those of you who are trying to decide between the two I think this might help.  First, the Cuisinart is a bit smaller than the Breville so if counter space is an issue than you might want to stick with the Cuisinart.  However, if you purchase the bamboo board for the top of the Breville it will give you a bit more \\""counter space as well as a dish warmer).  The problems that we ran into with the Cuisinart were:  1. The oven didn't heat evenly so if something was in there for awhile it was necessary to turn the pan around for more even cooking, 2. The finish of the oven got a bit strange over time - almost like there were some fingerprint areas that wouldn't come off with stainless steel cleaner so we decided it was some flaw in the finish 3. We are having to buy a new oven because the fans for the convection cooking started making a noise like they were warped and banging.  Like others we looked around and tried to decide whether we wanted to go back to Cuisinart (figuring things might have improved in the past 6 years), or try the Breville.  We decided to try the Breville as we had room for it and the other reviews were good.<br /><br />What I like... The Breville looks lovely, feels sturdy (heavier) and seems better made overall than the Cuisinart.  Like other reviewers I did order the bamboo board for the top of it and I'm glad I did (I'm reviewing the board on it's page).  The Breville does NOT have a blue lit digital readout as others have said, it's grey and then when it's on it's sort of beige color.  It's blue in the picture because that's the plastic film that protects the glass over the digital read out and it looks prettier than the actual display.  Although the Breville seemed confusing with all the knobs it's quite simple to use AND it has a memory for the last thing you cooked.  So.. say you eat a baked potato two days in a row (if you don't cook something else in between and change the settings) when you turn on the oven to bake it's all set for your baked potato preferences!  The oven does cook evenly, no turning the pan and the toast is even, the baking is even and the boiler is too - WOW - that's enough to make me happy I got this oven.  Also I LOVE LOVE LOVE the magnetic door opener!  I can't tell you how many times I've been burned on the Cuisinart just trying to reach in there and pull out the rack!  Also, another huge plus is having the crumb drawer in the FRONT of this machine - how easy is that!  With the Cuisinart you have to unplug, turn the thing around, pull out the drawer, clean it, put it back in and turn it back around again.  With the Breville - pull out the drawer, dump crumbs and stick it back in... convenient!<br /><br />I'm racking my brain trying to think of the drawbacks with the Breville.  I guess size would be one if you are in a smaller kitchen, and as others have said the electric cord is a bit short but luckily I have a plug near where it needed to be and the display not being blue could be a problem for some people.  That's all I can think of so to me they were all minor issues.<br /><br />I'm very happy with the Breville and I hope it lives a long and happy life!  If it doesn't I'll let you know.e Breville seemed confusing with all the knobs it's quite simple to use AND it has a memory for the last thing you cooked.

The oven has performed flawlessly with one small flaw. The convection oven fan has gotten noise with age. The noise level is not objectionable and isn't even noticeable if there is any background noise like the TV. Overall, I'm still very happy with the purchase.<br /><br />Our primary use for the oven is baking. Now that there are only two of us in our house the 800XL is our primary oven when we are baking cookies and cakes or a roast. With the convection feature roasts and chickens brown nicely though I do tend to turn the pan 180 degrees about two thirds of the way through the cooking time as I think it browns more evenly that way.<br /><br />I purchase the Breville 800XL Toaster Oven from Amazon about a month age. (For purpose of full disclosure I purchased a remanufactured oven not a new one) After using if for a month I feel that I am ready to write a review.<br /><br />Let's start with one of the main complaints about the oven that I found when reading the earlier reviews, the size of the plug. The 800XL has a large plug that keeps the oven from being placed close to the wall. The owners manual tells you to keep the oven three (might have been four) inches from the wall. Well that's just about the size of the plug. So the plug is designed to keep you from placing the oven too close to the wall.If you're complaining about the how the plug wont let you place the oven next to the wall your trying to put the oven too close.<br /><br />Accuracy of temperature. After using the oven for a couple of weeks to break it in I used my oven thermometer and tested the temperature at 170, 350 and 450 degrees. In all cases the oven thermometer read about 10 degrees low. So I don't know if the oven or the thermometer was off. But it was off at a consistent rate so I don't really care as 10 degrees wont make any real difference.<br /><br />Difficulty of use. The 800XL's user interface is a little funky and the manual doesn't do a good job of describing how to program the oven. So let's take a look at the two things that I had to get used to:<br /><br />1) You have to press the on button twice to get the oven into baking mode. The first time you press the button the oven goes into program mode. You know its in program mode when the display has a blue background, Once you set the mode, temp and time you need to press the start button once more to put it in baking mode.In baking mode the display is orange.<br /><br />2) The 800XL automatically starts the timer when it reaches the predetermined temperature. This means that if you are not in the kitchen when it announces that it has reached operational temperature you will need to adjust the timer when you put your food in the oven.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a problem as it heats up so quickly that I put my food in the oven when I program it. Potentially, this could be a problem if you were baking something very delicate but for most things it isn't.<br /><br />The oven is smaller than your stove oven so things tend to cook more quickly so I usually set the timer for five minutes less than the recipe calls for and check to see how things are progressing.<br /><br />One nice feature or curse depending on your point of view is that the oven remembers your last use for each of the modes. So if you were baking a chicken at 450 and want to bake some cookies you will have to remember to reset the temperature and time or you will incinerate your cookies. Actually, once I got used to this feature I really liked it as I tend to use the same setting over and over again.<br /><br />The controls are the one thing that keeps me from giving the 800XL a five star review. In reality if I could take off just a half star I would and give the oven a 4.5 star review. For a $200+ oven the knobs feel REALLY CHEAP. Will it affect the longevity of the oven? I don't know. I'm not real rough on my equipment but if I has a couple of young boys I'd be concerned that they would over time break the controls.<br /><br />Oven size. Breville is really vague about the oven size. So let's start from the top. If you have a 13\\""x9\\"" cake pan with handles, it wont fit. If you have a 13\\""x9\\"" cake pan without any handles it will just fit. A quarter size sheet pan also fits perfectly in the oven. In fact the primary pan that I use in this oven is a quarter sheet pan that I got at Costco a couple of years ago. I also have a lasagne dish that fits easily in the oven and it comes with a broiler pan and wire rack that work well for baking or broiling roasts and steaks.<br /><br />The crumb tray. The tray is accessible from the front but what it doesn't have is a lip at the back of the tray so if you not careful you can dump the crumbs in the oven when you remove the tray like I did the first time I tried to empty the tray.<br /><br />The magnetic tray opener. The oven has a magnet in the door that will drag the wire rack out of the oven a couple of inches for easy access. What they don't tell you in their description is that the magnet feature only works in the baking (middle) position.<br /><br />Racks. It would be nice if the oven came with two racks so that you could bake two sheets of cookies at a time. It doesn't and I really shouldn't eat more than one pan of cookies at any given time anyway.<br /><br />The oven exterior gets hot. Please give me a break. Of course the exterior gets hot its a little metal box with a large heating element in it. The exterior doesn't get hot enough to burn you unless you tried to pick it up or placed your hand on it for an extended period of time. My old Cuisinart toaster oven got hot as well so its not unique to the 800XL. The nice thing about the fact that it gets hot is that you can warm your plates on the top of the oven while you are cooking your dinner. Living in Oregon we have distinct seasons and I like to warm my dinner dishes during the cooler months. If you want to use the top of the oven to store things Breville sells a small cutting board designed to sit on top of the oven.<br /><br />To be honest I've never toasted anything in the oven so I can't attest to the toasting feature. We have a very nice Cuisinart toaster and use it for toasting bread and bagels.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with the oven and would recommend it. The 800XL replaced a Cuisinart toaster oven that we had for years and would still have if it had been a little bigger.The 800XL is large enough that we now only use our stove oven for major entertaining like Thanksgiving and Christmas. I looked at a lot of ovens and had to think for a long time about buying a $200+ toaster oven but in the end I'm very happy with the oven.<br /><br />One last point, I called Breville customer service to ask a question and found their people to be efficient, polite and helpful.<br /><br />Update: I received a request for the size of the rack. The rack is 11.5\\"" x 14\\"". The usable space is slightly less as the rack slides into a groove on the side of the interior.

I've waited to review it so I'd be past the honeymoon stage. After several months of beautiful roast chickens, yummy cookies and perfect pizzas made exclusively in this toaster oven I just made an entire old-fashioned Thanksgiving dinner with it. I roasted turkey, toasted bread for stuffing, made pie and baked stuffing - the oven never failed. Absolutely no loss of temperature or even a hint of over-heating. To be fair, I break my turkey down and only roast the full breast and a single leg quarter. I doubt a whole turkey would fit but the oven produces the most gorgeous and delicious roast chickens. It's a very versatile appliance, perfect for everyday cooking. Using it has also reduced my electric bill.

Our standard oven is gas and it does a terrible job compared to this one.  We have had ours for almost two years and it does an excellent job on small baking tasks.  Heats quickly and accurately.  Roasted veggies are fast and easy.  Pizza is good with a good pan.  Toast is pretty slow but reliable.<br /><br />Here are my gripes:<br />1) The thing has no way to turn off the beeping...We have a kitchen off the bedrooms in a small house and the tripple double beep is really annoying just to say the toast is done.<br />2) The start button is never responsive the first push and you have to tap it 2-4 times to make it go...seems to be some design flaw with waking up the display.<br />3) The crumb tray is some coated cheap steel pan that is impossible to clean...it says non-stick which is not true.  This pan should be stainless since the entire outside is or enamel so you can actually clean it.,2012-11-22

I really did like the oven very much and found I was using it instead of the range oven which saves on energy. It was accurate, fast and big enough to fit a 12\\"" pizza.<br />The bad thing is the oven just stopped working after 16 months. One day it was working and the next it was like it wasn't plugged in. Nothing I have found will bring it back to life so the bottom line is this oven though great when working will not stand the test of time. So if you want to pay $17.18 a month which is the price divided by the months it worked then I recommend it. If this is not a good deal in your opinion I suggest looking at Cusinart and that is what I will do.",2012-11-20

I was baking something and right in the middle it turned off and on a couple times and then completely died. We tried checking the fuses and plugging it into different outlets with no luck. Unfortunately the warranty is only good for 1 year and we were just a couple months over a year so we were SOL. I can't believe that a $250 toaster oven would only last just over a year!!! We were SOOO disappointed after spending so much. Sadly after reading the reviews I see we aren't the only people this has happened to. It works great while it works, but it's not built to last and definitely not worth the price! We replaced it with a Waring- it was a lot cheaper so I won't be as upset if it doesn't last forever.

Now that I'm familiar with how it works, I find myself using it for just about everything. In fact, I think I only used my regular oven once last week.<br />I roasted a chicken, which came out juicy and perfectly browned, and I also made a batch of muffins, which took several minutes less to bake because of the convection feature.<br />The only trouble I had was when I went to make toast. I followed the instructions in the manual, which tell you to leave the rack in the middle. I set the darkness to \\""4\\"" thinking that would result in a medium brown. But when the bell rang signaling the end of the toasting, my bread was still pale and soft. The next time, I cranked the darkness to \\""5\\"" but the toast was still not properly browned. I finally moved the rack to the highest level and  that, combined with the \\""5\\"" produced decent toast. Eureka!<br />Other than that, everything has been easy to figure out and use.<br />I do wish they'd figure out a way to keep the power cord away from the oven, though. It gets so hot, it would easily melt the cord if it touched the oven wall. I ended up taping the cord to the wall behind the oven, so it would be out of harm's way.",2012-10-21

Like there was no power.  I checked the outlet and it was fine.  The unit just totally died.  I researched a little and it sounds like this is not uncommon for this Breville and the warranty on it is only for a year.  I guess I will go back to cheaper toaster ovens since, if it's going to die anyway at least I won't have spent so much.",2012-10-15

In August of 2012, my oven stopped working entirely so I took to the internet and researched the issue. Several sites had customers complaining how bad the oven was and that Breville lacked any sense of Customer Service. After reading some of these highly negative reviews my doubts about resolving our problem soared.<br /><br />I logged into my Breville account and fired off a \\""contact request\\"" charged with less than favorable commentary. Several days later I received a reply from Breville apologizing for the poor experience. They simply asked when did I purchase the oven and what was the Batch Number on the plate located on the back of the oven. To shorten the story, I later received an email with a prepaid Fedex Shipping label and a simple request to box up my oven carefully and return to Breville. Their promise was to send me another \\""refurbished\\"" oven (I'm okay with that) within 10-14 business days.<br /><br />Today, 8 calendar days later (and 2 years 9 months later without a receipt for proof of purchase), I received my replacement oven. Its condition was so perfect, you would not have known it to be refurbished had Breville not already stated so. I am a realistic consumer and understand things go wrong sometimes. The value of a manufacturer will only show through in how they resolve such issues. In my mind Breville is a company of high value. To those whose experience left them less than satisfied, I would recommend sending an email to brevilleusa.com simply stating their issue and provide the batch number from their unit.

I can't remember not having one.<br /><br />The first one I got was back in the 70s!!  Needless to say, by today's standards, it was just a fancy toaster.<br /><br />NONE of them compare to this one.<br /><br />This Breville ... \\""machine\\"" (toaster does not do it justice) has replaced ALL my other gizmos and gadgets.<br /><br />Two years ago, I got 2 different appliances - 1 was an Oster convection oven, and another was a \\""light wave\\"" oven. Both<br />were \\""new\\"" featured toaster ovens. Over time, I used the Oster for toast, bagels, and to broil steaks. It was an okay<br />toaster oven...nothing special. The light wave was used almost exclusively for baked potatoes...and the occasional slice of bacon...the settings were kinda strange.<br /><br />Those will both soon find a new home at the local Goodwill, as my brand new Breville will do the job of both of them, and more.<br /><br />The Breville machine is top of the line in appearance. It's clearly well made, not a cheezy part on it. It's very accurate. The temperature and timing are fine tuned and precise. I don't hear the fan at all.<br /><br />I've made baked potatoes, toast, pizza, and rolls. They came out so well, I was confident that I could broil a lobster in it...so I did!<br /><br />I  broiled two lobster tails in it, and they came out high restaurant-quality!! I sat the butter on top of the unit while cooking, and it melted perfectly. I would NEVER have cooked lobster with either of the other two toaster ovens...they didn't have the capacity either in room or in correct/accurate heat; they would have come out burned on top and raw on the bottom.<br /><br />Both lobster tails came out of the Breville, and were just slightly browned on top (I'd put butter on the top) and cooked through. At 10 Oz each, they only took 10 minutes to broil. They were perfect.<br /><br />I can't recommend this Breville enough. I love it.  It doesn't heat up my kitchen (in Florida, that's a requirement) even though the top gets really hot. I just use the silicone oven gloves I got some time ago, and no problem. But do be careful - it is really easy to burn yourself.

It fits a full sized 14\\"" pizza just perfectly. OH, reheating foods in this thing is heavenly! It makes everything taste like it was JUST cooked fresh, so restuarant carry-outs will be saved with this oven (just eat within 2-3 days after getting it). It can make some awesome toast, too. We had a bread toaster, but it started to smoke and that was the end of owning one, so this oven replaced that as well.<br />You can reheat chinese food in it too and it will taste just like it did at the restaurant- it had me so shocked! Everything this oven features and has to offer, it serves up to its full potential and leaves no room for regrets of buying one.<br />It gets used EVERY.SINGLE.DAY.FOR.ALMOST.EVERYTHING!

For the price, it should last longer.<br /><br />Edited to add:<br />Breville replaced my original BOV800XL with a refurbished oven in April 2012. This oven was slightly different with a reddish LED display and a body that felt slightly cheaper. The refurbished oven lasted exactly 1 year. Unfortunately they only give a 6-month warranty on the refurbished oven, so it was 6-months out of warranty. I called Breville's customer service and they would only give me a 20% coupon off a new one. Well, that isn't much considering currently the oven on Amazon is 17% off the original price! I asked about having the refurbished oven fixed. They said it would cost almost as much as buying a new one. So In two years, I have had two ovens and both stopped working without any misuse by us. I am moving on to another brand that lasts longer and is cheaper. This brand may consider their products luxury, but they are cheaply made.

Therefore, we were very particular when searching for a replacement.  The Breville is definitely an improvement for us with newer technology and sleeker lines.  Controls are easy to use and intuitive.  The oven cooks really well - very even whether baking, toasting or using bagel setting.  And, it does well with 6 slices of toast or just one. This is a feat I've never seen done before!<br /><br />I have two requests for improvement.  First, only the \\""toast\\"" placement of the rack has a automatic pull forward.  I would like to see the other positions have some sort of pop-out.  Second, I think the light on the display stays on too long.  For someone who is paranoid about not turning off appliances (me!) it is a bit disconcerting to have the light on several minutes after I've finished with it.

Last, this isn't really a fault with the oven itself but I would have liked it if the trays had some way of gripping the pan because when I open the door and the tray slides out, sometimes the pan wants to slide off.

I had a Black and Decker model for years that finally pooped out.  I decided to splurge on this one because I used my old one so much.  I use it every morning for toasting something, but find I use it every afternoon/evening for a snack for kids (great for cookies), or preparing something for dinner.  In the summer, it's great to not have to wamr up the big oven and make the room warm. I've been consistently pleased with the operation and results from this oven.<br /><br />I am lucky to have an electrician for a husband who also happened to wire our house.  The outlet for this oven was already dedicated, so I didn't need to worry about running the coffee maker or microwave at the same time.  That is an important thing to check before purchasing this, as noted in other reviews.<br /><br />I also purchased the oven liner and that has been a dream helping with cleanup of those nasty crumbs/spills.<br /><br />PROS<br /> * LOVE the look and the size of the oven.  It fits perfectly in the space I had available.<br /> * LOVE the even cooking.  I no longer have muffins that are half burnt.  From english muffins to cookies to sweet potatoes or warming ham, it performs like a dream.<br /> * LOVE the interior size of the oven and the trays that come with it- especially the pizza/cookie tray!<br /> * LOVE the pop-out feature of the shelf.<br /><br />CONS<br /> * Maybe one.  My old Black and Decker had a nifty little tool that you could use to pull out the tray and then set somewhere to cool and remove your food.  That's being a little picky, though.

I contacted Breville and they sent me a new oven after they received the bad one from me.  The new one worked great for about 5 months until today. I was toasting bread and during the toast cycle the oven just quit, no power.  I tried different receptacles and still got no power to the oven.  I was also starting to have the same issues with the control knobs as I had with the first oven.  I have contacted Breville and will be receiving another oven.  I also discovered while talking to Breville that the 12 month warranty last from the date of the original purchase. This means that I will have 2 months of warranty left when I receive my 3rd oven.

I have a six burner Viking oven with a large oven, but now that our kids have moved out, it's usually just the two of us, so I tend to cook dinner in the Breville.  I have roasted, broiled, baked, and warmed and the worse thing that has happened is that when baking two 9x5 loaves of banana bread which required 1 hour and 10 minutes one got slightly scorched on the top.  I have since learned that for extended baking times it is best to lower the rack partway through cooking time and rotate the goods.  Cookies, cakes, brownies all come out lovely.<br /><br />This oven is easy to clean and best of all it shuts itself off automatically, whereas my large commercial oven has no such timed feature. I have had this for two years and would buy it again in a heartbeat.<br /><br />One note of caution, I do agree with other reviewers that their customer service sucks.  When I first got this the broiler pan that came with it had some of its enamel chipped off so I thought I should get it replaced.  I called them and they made me jump through hoops telling me there was some number on the back panel that was required...after searching the entire oven (which is not so huge that I wouldn't find whatever it was they wanted) I told her it wasn't there yet she INSISTED that it had to  be.

My new Electrolux oven died recently (it was going to cost as much to fix it as I paid for it) and I bought the Breville to use until I could decide on what to replace the Electrolux with.  I will not replace the $3000 stove that died, I won't need to, the Breville does everything perfectly, and the perfect size for our two-person household.  I use the Electrolux oven to store cookware and pans in now, lol.  I highly recommend the Breville.  It is really worth it.  I would also recommend getting the Breville bamboo cutting board accessory that sits atop the Smart Oven.  The top gets quite warm (makes a nice warming top) but I was concerned the heat might damage the bottom of my cupboards.  The cutting board keeps the heat from rising, also a fine cutting board as well.  If I want to warm plates, I just remove it while using the Smart Oven.

The most recent the top end Cuisinart one that I just gave to my mom when I replaced it with this.  It was fine, but I just am not a big fan of the bubble buttons.  I wasn't even looking for a new toaster oven when I came across something that showed a picture of this in it, so I had to find it.  Did some digging, found it online, and just loved the design.  So even though I was satisfied with the Cuisinart and had not planned on replacing it, I ordered this.<br /><br />Arrived incredibly well packaged - I was a little worried because the UPS person was pretty rough with the box.  But everything is packed individually nice solid foam.<br /><br />Got disassembled and did the initial bake they recommend to remove the protective coating from the elements.  They warned about smoke and smell, but I had no smoke and very little smell, so it was a piece of cake.<br /><br />Tested with a frozen pizza - I have my own 13\\"" pizza pan with holes in it so I used that in here.  Instead of doing what the box stated or time and temp as I always have, I simply dialed in frozen 12\\"" pizza and let it rip.  And it came out perfect.<br /><br />The display is one of the clearest and crispest displays I've ever seen for a kitchen appliance.  Very easy to read, pleasing to the eye.  There is no clock function, which was fine by me since it's one less thing to fix in case of a power outage.  The display also never turns off completely.  The blue backlight turns off but the display stays on in the background.  It's also nice how it turns orange during cooking - a very clear visible sign that it's heating.  There's a reddish orange ring around the start/cancel button as well that lights up.<br /><br />There's plenty of space in it.<br /><br />I also really like the magnetic catches on the door that pull the rack out several inches when you open the door.  Very nicely done.<br /><br />And another nice surprise for me was a FRONT loading crumb tray.  In hindsight, the one thing I really hated on the cuisinart one was that I had to pull it out and spin it around to pull the tray out of the back.  Stupid design.  This one doesn't suffer from that.<br /><br />Everything I've tried so far has turned out great.  It really does work its own program to adjust the heating to do the best job, and I've not had anything so far come out bad.<br /><br />A great toaster oven, not only visually appealing, but well designed for ease of use as well as how well it cooks.

Both ovens are convection and use infra-red elements (as opposed to nichrome elements in cheaper ovens) and the same \\""smart\\"" technology...so they are both very fast at heating up and keeping a constant, computer-controlled temperature; but the Breville is better...much better. What's more, this oven can take a 13\\"" wide roasting pan with room to spare without any trouble, but it has the same footprint on the counter as the Krups, which is limited to an 11\\"" roasting pan.<br /><br />However, the Breville is far superior, especially in convection mode. I never was one for presets, but the presets on the Breville actually work and are totally adjustable... and the oven remembers the last setting for whatever preset you used previously. You usually have to change those presets each time anyway, but the oven works differently for every preset... and they work...I do not know how ... but they work. Of course, you can always set the oven to anything you wish regardless of the presets...and it only takes a few seconds...just turn a knob to do so...no waiting for a digital device to go through a complete cycle.<br /><br />To test out the pizza preset, we bought four small cheap frozen pizzas. The first pizza was baked on the pizza setting without convection and without the frozen setting. The results were pretty good. The second was baked with the convection setting on, but with the frozen setting off. It came out slightly dry on top. The third pizza was baked with the frozen setting on and the convection on. The results were on the dry side. The fourth pizza was baked with the frozen setting on and the convection setting off.

My made-from scratch Mac & Cheeze... with two baking cycles (covered and uncovered) followed by a broil for 3 minutes... best ever!  In fact, everything came out better than it used to in my big oven.<br /><br />So the only reason I'll ever fire up my regular gas oven is for turkey and other big stuff like brontosaurus ribs or something.<br /><br />I did see that a noticeable number of reviews mentioned the oven croaking.  They were able to get replacements, but they had to pack the thing up in a box and ship it back, and be without for days or weeks.  In spite of those reviews I rolled the dice and hoped mine will be one of the majority that seem to last.  BUT, I bought mine at BB&Beyond, so if mine croaks, I won't have to pack it and ship it - I'll just toss it in the trunk, take it back to BB&B, and get another.<br /><br />I paid sales tax, but I thought the peace of mind is worth the extra 20 bucks for the tax.<br /><br />The oven is great - I'm really super-pleased with it!<br /><br />I'd recommend rolling the dice and getting one... but at a local store where you can return if need be.<br /><br />PS:  The sides and top do get hot to touch.

Let me save you some time and hassle. If you are looking at this toaster as an option and the price didn't completely scare you away, than buy it.<br /><br />I bought and returned the following before getting the Smart oven.<br />1. Breville compact smart oven. Which is fine except I wanted convection. I read a website that said it was convection, its not.<br />2. Delonghi D01289. It burnt half my toast and other half was under cooked. I feel it should be a good toaster first and everything else should be extra. You have to go through the entire control system to get you toast the way you like it.<br />3. Kitchenaid countertop convection oven. If it was digital i would have kept this one. The toast was great but couldnt get the same toast everytime.<br />4. Oster digital toaster oven. From target. I got this one home plugged it in and there was a non stop humming coming from the LED light it was annoying. really annoying. Not the best toast either.<br /><br />My wife thought i was being a little picky for a toaster oven, i like to think i was being thourough. I bought the breville smart oven and it cooked some beautiful toast, and it remembers how i like my toast so I dont have to run through the controls everyday. If it does toast this good let me try some more stuff. I went to the store and got some fries and a pizza, and some frozen waffles, you get the point. It cooked everything great. I did have to turn the pizza, It is a bit cooler by the window of the toaster oven. Well I hope my trial and error helps you decide to buy this and not waste your time shipping things back and forth. Luckily I got free shipping both ways from the same place i buy my shoes. Except the one from target i had to bring that one back myself.",2012-08-13

So far we have used it for pies, large square cakes, quiches, and toasting bread that does not fit in the toaster. Everything cooked in the expected time with perfect results. Because of a slight difference in temperature between the front and the back the manual advises to rotate the baking pan at half-time. This is not a problem. The controls are very easy to use.

I guess people cut into their food on it. I don't have one scratch on mine and use it for a lot of things. Food slides right off of it. If I do need a little help I always use a coated spatula . I did get the Bamboo cutting board but through Bed Bath and Beyond as they ordered me the right size and for less than they were selling on Amazon. I don't use it but to rest something hot on it and to keep the heat away from my cabinets. ( tip for you ) I put felt sliders on the bottom feet so I can slide it away from the wall and back easy.

I love this oven, the way it looks, the way it works, they way it is constructed, pretty much everything about it.  I have cooked bacon, fries, chicken, and toasted both bread and English muffins in it.  Everything comes out perfectly.  The bacon is crisp but never dried.  Everything comes out very well.  I am actually contemplating doing some ribs in the oven as I have read reviews and seen videos of people ding the ribs in the convection oven that come out great.  The oven actually comes with very specific information in the instructional booklet for various types of cooking and if you follow the booklet, yo should have no cooking problems.<br /><br />I have not used my oven once since making this purchase, I do not plan on using it in the foreseeable future, unless it is absolutely necessary to do so. I find that using parchment paper is the perfect accompaniment for the pans that are included in the oven as it enables you to cook and not worry about grease or sticking.<br /><br />I would like to take a moment to address a concern expressed by other purchasers: The oven not getting as hot as it is supposed to.  While researching prior to my purchase, I found several other reviews on different sites that mentions this issue as well.  One of the most in-depth reviews I read stated that if you turn off the convection portion of the oven, which is easy to do, you simply press the convection button, and use the regular/toaster oven in pre-heating, the oven will reach the required temperature.  You then just turn on the convection oven as you place your food in for cooking.<br /><br />I definitely would reccommed the Breville Smart Oven to anyone in search of a convection oven, or even a top of the line toaster.",2012-06-28

With it's excellent build quality, and design layout Breville's Engineers have done an excellent job with this. I have also ran a 20 min pre-operational burn in at 450 to remove any petro chemical residues, and the unit heated very quickly, and all seems to be working fine. It does however pull some watts as my lights in the house dimmed a bit so keep that in mind.

I have already used it twice and so far I love it.  The instruction book is one of the most complete I have ever seen with an appliance...in a way almost too much, but it covers everything.<br /><br />UPDATE -. I have had this oven since 2012. I used it, every day, and at least twice a day. I lost it yesterday due to a weird accident. I was cleaning it and partially angled it on my stove top so I could reach into it better. When I moved it around, it accidently hit the knob that turned on a jet it was sitting over and the cord burned along with the bottom of the oven. This. was no fault of the oven, but an accident. If that had not happened, I would still be using that oven. Five years worth of cooking everything from soup to nuts was a pleasure. As soon as I can get some exta money together, I plan to get another one. I never use my big oven anymore. I would definitely recommend.<br /><br />So far I have done bacon using the broiling pans and last night did lamb chops which came out almost like butter.  Excellent cooking job.<br /><br />They give you recommendations for shelf height and temperature, but I actually lowered my shelf when I broiled the lamb chops because I didn't want them to cook that quickly.  You definitely can experiment with the options to see what works best for what you are cooking.<br /><br />I only gave it four stars because while my broiling pans came sealed in plastic, there were spots where the enamel coating was chipped and missing...mostly in corners.  Could be from shipping damage.  Rather than ship the whole thing back, just to get new pans, Amazon offered me three options, one of which was to get a partial refund to cover the damage on the pans.  That worked well for me.  Great job Amazon Customer Service.<br /><br />Also, I didn't have to check fuses and I do have it in a recessed area in my kitchen though there is enough space around it to allow for air circulation.  Like any other toaster oven, it gets hot and you have to be careful.<br /><br />This oven is definitely worth it.<br /><br />Update: - May 18, 2013<br /><br />I misread how the timer worked a month or two after I received it.  I called Breville and the immediately gave me an authorization for return and had me ship it back to them.  I received my new one about 2 weeks later.  When I received the new one, I thought it had the same error.  When I called again, customer service stayed with me on the phone and walked me through the settings.  What I thought was the oven resetting itself, simply turned out to be the way the time reads when it goes from :10 (minutes) to 9:00 minutes.  You can imagine my embarrassment.  But their customer service was wonderful and helpful.  She said they are looking into updating the way the time changes as it countsdown because they had other calls concerning the same thing.<br /><br />I love my Breville oven.  I use it constantly and if it ever breaks again, I will buy another one.  Like most other people, I do wish it had a light in it.  It is well worth the extra money.e to be careful.  This oven is definitely worth it.  Update: - May 18, 2013  I misread how the timer worked a month or two after I received it.

We're doing the empty nest thing and the 800 is the poster child for that style of living. Simple, elegant, easy to use and look at, and it cleans up nice. I won't make any unequivocal statements that enshrine the high cost in some kind of must have mantra. It's pricey, no way around that. Call it a countertop oven if that's what it takes for you to look at yourself in the mirror, but it's a toaster oven, a 250$ toaster oven. If you want a top of the line toaster oven, this here is the line to get in. Want a cheap one? Turn the page. No relief for you here.<br /><br />So the pros.<br />If your wife has no patience for your efforts to help her outfit the kitchen, this machine will get you a little cred. Maybe when the incredibly stout package shows up at the door she'll consider leaving you and it to rot on the stoop. However, just go about your business of uncrating it without conversation or any sidelong glances. Eat up an inordinate amount of her precious counter space placing the beast and suffer the running commentary about that lost space and the use of LCD's and whatever else she can come up with to chastise you about from 10 feet away.<br />Do not cheap out on the optional cutting board. It is not only functional as a heat buffer but it's styling enough to pique her interest. That makes it an integral component and it should have been part of the standard kit even if it created an opportunity for Breville to jack the price further.<br /><br />So now this thing is plugged in and you have run it through the manufacturers suggested \\""burn the oils away\\"" sequence. In my case it seemed to do nothing but I don't doubt the value in the activity.<br />At this point walk away. Don't bring it up to her, don't even go near it. The machine can sell itself without your help. It will too. Mark my words.<br /><br />So now we're getting this ridiculously evenly cooked golden brown toast. Well, topside anyways. Bottomside has grill style pattern from the shelf. No matter. Great toast. That concludes my toast remarks.<br /><br />It does indeed cook well and although we still use the range top for boiling and whatnot, the two of us get by fine with baking entrees in the 800. Less left overage, clean up is a snap and I don't have to adjust the AC to compensate for the heat from the oven.<br /><br />The cons. No oven light. Really? How utterly unnecessary. I'm just saying the object of your efforts is on a countertop cooking away in a glass doored toaster oven. You can't get your visual information without a light? OTOH, 250 clams. It was a bridge too far to put a light in it? Oh well, it gives her something to mench about. So be it.<br /><br />The other con. Man I wish I had a camera. So, we grabbed Papa Murphy's pizza out of sheer laziness. They assemble your pie and you cook it at home kind of business model. Fair enough, especially since we had a couple weeks previously done a supermarket frozen pizza and it seemed to taste better than expected so we figured one from the Papa would set well.<br /><br />She was in command and my job was to stay out of the way. I heard the dings of the 800 announcing that pizza was done and I heard the 800 door open and then I heard the expletives.<br />The shelf, as has been reported ad nauseum slides partially out when the door is opened. It is a good thing and kind of cool. The provided pizza pan sports a non skid coating. So she opened the door, obviously after she and Doctor Bruce Banner were doused in gamma radiation, with enough force that the tray slid forward and the pizza pan slid forward as well. The shelf stopped sliding, the pizza pan alas did not.<br /><br />When I arrived at the scene of the crime the pizza was lying on the floor, toppings side down of course. My lovely bride, light of my life, was spewing venom like a gangsta longshoreman.<br /><br />We had a quiet dinner of leftovers.<br /><br />She still likes the 800 but now calls her oven mitt her catchers mitt. The best part is she did not blame me for the runaway pizza... so far.<br /><br />Anyways, the skinny.<br />Pricy as all getout.-No likee<br />Front crumb drawer- Likee<br />No interior light- No likee but besides feeling cheated I have no good reason for one<br />Slideout shelf- awesome and makes cooking an adventure<br />Included cookware- nice touch but you have to take the holistic perspective when they use the term non skid.<br />Well built- check<br />Controls well designed- check<br />Simple- check<br />Cutting board- must have option = oxymoron (but do get it)<br />Easy cleanup- checkart is she did not blame me for the runaway pizza... so far.<br /><br />Anyways, the skinny.<br />Pricy as all getout.-No likee<br />Front crumb drawer- Likee<br />No interior light- No likee but besides feeling cheated I have no good reason for one<br />Slideout shelf- awesome and makes cooking an adventure<br />Included cookware- nice touch but you have to take the holistic perspective when they use the term non skid.<br />Well built- check<br />Controls well designed- check<br />Simple- check<br />Cutting board- must have option = oxymoron (but do get it)<br />Easy cleanup- check",2012-06-17

But I think it would have been even nicer if it had a few additional features for the price as discussed below.<br /><br />We use this oven every day, and it saves electricity and produces less heat in the kitchen than the big oven while delivering big oven performance.  The convection function works well, and the user interface (display and controls) are easy to use and offer a variety of functions.  I believe it is probably the best consumer-version toaster oven available out there, and I'm glad I bought it.  All that said, for the price premium you are paying over other toaster ovens, it would be nice to see a few other \\""premium\\"" features -- one or more of the additional features I would like to see are:  1) an internal light (the oven is fairly deep and the interior can be dark when the door closes and its cooking); 2) a delay start timer; 3) sturdier controls (the knobs are made of light plastic and feel like they could break if used to hard or too much -- although I concede that they could actually be stronger than they appear); 4) a sturdier wire slide-in rack; and/or 5) maybe some more insulation (most toaster ovens don't have any real insulation, but for the price it would be nice if this oven had a little more than average).<br /><br />Of course, it's entirely possible that the five quartz heating elements, digital (\\""element IQ\\"") heat control, and the three nice included cooking pans are primarily responsible for its higher price, and that the features I discuss above would be impractical.

It had a one year limited warranty.  Last week (May 20, 2012) I was baking a pizza and the oven went dead.  No indication of power to the unit of any kind.  After searching for known issues with this model on the internet, I found quite a few negative reviews of Breville's customer service for defective products or warranty repairs.  Knowing my oven was out of warranty, I still felt that for the oven to die after 20 months of service was unacceptable and decided to look into contacting their customer service.  I was pretty riled up and had my armor on and was ready for a battle, based on some of the reviews I had read.  I called their customer service number and a very pleasant woman answered, asked a few questions about the problem and my product details and then stated \\""We will send you a FedEx label by email to return the unit to us, and when FedEx scans the label on your return box, we will immediately ship you a brand new replacement, a swap out.\\"" I received the brand new oven five days later. Wow!  Now THAT was a surprise! There must have been a known issue with my oven batch, but nevertheless, this is about a company standing behind their product and acting honorably.  6 stars.",2012-05-26

I absolutely agree with all the complaints that it beeps \\""ready-heated up\\"" good 75F too early.  It IS designed to beep early, because much LATER it WILL heat up to the desired temperature AND keep it.  This is done on purpose to hide insufficient insulation and heat loss.<br /><br />I have had a Delonghi for 10 years.  When it beeped - it was within 5 degrees of the preset temperature; it was also smaller and 12\\"" pizza did not fit.  Yet it was so efficient that I had to reduce the minimum suggested cooking time by a couple of minutes.  With Breveille, I have to add to the longest suggested time.<br /><br />Bottom line - what used to be 17 minutes now takes 25-30.  The main reason - I wanted a bigger oven - I got a bigger oven, but 200 watt increment cannot compensate for the heat loss of the much bigger box that has no insulation whatsoever!  So, my cooking routine is<br />1. set the cooking parameters<br />2. start the unit<br />3. wait for the Breveille \\""ready\\"" beep<br />4. go to the kitchen and add 5 minutes to the large oven timer to get the beep when it WILL be actually ready (tested with the oven thermometers)<br />5.

The oven heats much quicker than my large gas oven and cools off much more quickly, so as not to heat the house like a a regular oven does.  The convection option is worth the additional price over the smaller version of this, it helps cook everything more evenly than my conventional oven and also cuts down the cooking time on average.  Keep in mind, this is not a small oven and does take up some counter space.  The non-stick pizza pan that comes with the oven is great, we use it all the time.

I great prefer them to traditional toasters due to their versatility. We had a GE one which lasted a decade- very well-made & durable, bought in 1984. We've since had ones from Black & Decker, Cuisinart, DeLonghi & a couple of other brands. After our GE one died, we never again found another oven that had it all, was easy to get food out of, and baked food evenly. There was always some issue- the center of an English muffin wouldn't brown while the edges got too dark. The rack wouldn't come out when you opened the broiler oven door, forcing you to reach into a dangerously-hot small oven & yank out food as quickly as possible w/ a knife or tongs (hoping you didn't drop it on the heating element below!) The bottom catch-all rach under the heating element wouldn't come out easily, or clean up well. Again, always some stupid but major issue which caused little but a big headache & unimpressive food.<br /><br />I own a Breville coffeemaker, the kind that uses K-Cups. I've owned that since 2007, purchasing an upgraded one in 2010. I was so incredibly impressed with everything I ever bought from the Breville line that I thought, well, how bad the broiler oven be? Over time, the good reviews on every website & catalog stuck out with this item. Despite the rather steep cost at the time, we invested in this- and have never looked back. It is truly the oven of my dreams. I cook at home every night, and have for twenty years. I've owned many a George Foreman grill, a food chopper, a blender, regular toaster ovens, etc. Never have I felt so much love for a small appliance as I do for this Breville oven! (Though my K-Cup coffeemaker is a close second!)<br /><br />The option is there to cook foods from frozen or not, at the touch of a button. Everything is labeled explicitly as to which setting to use, which temperature, even where to place the rack for each setting- right on the oven! I can set the minutes easily. I can increase or decrease the time as my items are cooking/baking. There is no guesswork anymore. It is precisely timed, and it's digital readout is large, bright & easy-to-read. Every night, my meat, starch & vegetables come out preceisely on time together now, because this machine is so incredibly accurate. I've found that either the directions for an item are absolutely spot-on with this oven, or it may take even a little less time because it's a convection oven, too. NEVER have I had an item take MORE time than what it says on the packaging for the food. This items heats quickly, but more importantly, it heats EVENLY. Every English muffin, bagel, piece of toast, hamburger bun (with or without cheese), hot dog roll, you name it- perfectly done. In approximately three years of ownership, I've had not one item get burnt by this machine, nor have I ever had to toss something because it didn't get heated through evenly. Steaks come out just beautifully, though I do put the broiler pan on a rack which is in the center, not the top, which is a variation from Breville's direction. I found that putting the broiler pan on a rack which was higher up than center caused smoking (due to the spurting fat from the meat). Pizza, as well, is something that I bake in the center, NOT on the bottom rack placement, which is again contradictory to instructions. But it just seems to work better that way. However, in all other instances (including baked casserole items like Chicken Divan), I do put the baking dish on the rack which is lettered \\""Bake\\"", and cook it at it's normal temperature. With the convection feature, be aware that some items may do best with either a 25-degree cut in baking temperature, or a slighly-shorter baking time. If the convection feature is turned off (which is an option), then the normal baking time/temperature will again apply.<br /><br />Every year at Christmastime, when my big oven is devoted to ham or turkey, I'm able to use this to turn out my knockout holiday corn pudding, which I bake in a rectangular Polish stoneware dish. It comes out evenly baked, beautifully-golden, and cooked in exactly the time the recipe calls for. When I say Christmas dinner is at three p.m., this machine helps me get my dinner served on the dot at that hour! My mother just about fell over with shock the first year this happened, since I was able to serve everything calmly & perfectly done at exactly the moment I said I would. There were no disasters like I've had with other broiler ovens in past years- the center of the casserole not getting done, rolls getting too brown on the bottom, the ham getting cold because the broiler oven was taking too long, etc.<br /><br />This oven is so much larger on the interior than my previous broiler, and yet the platform is not much larger. The top of this serves as a wonderful \\""warming tray\\"", as well, to keep rolls, biscuits, plates, etc. nice & hot while I wait for another item to finish cooking. The cooking rack is magnetized to the door, coming out as it should when the door is opened. This is safer & more secure. The heating element is well-covered, meaning that there is virtually no chance of a burnt-on piece of cheese (for example) causing that icky smoky smell or flare-ups to occur. So that is one more safety & taste issue solved, right there. Because the element is designed so well & is well-protected, I don't need to clean it up, which I was doing CONSTANTLY w/ my old broiler.<br /><br />This machine is easy to keep clean. Even the door seems to get much less of that burnt-on, browned staining, even with daily use. Windex & a few cotton cleaning towels keep this looking like new. I don't find that it easily shows fingerprints or other spots.<br /><br />This came with a round pizza pan & a two-piece broiler set. The broiler set holds three large or four small/medium steaks. The round pizza pan also works great for fries, rolls, biscuits, and more. Nothing has ever burned on either one of these pans. The pizza pan, especially, is nonstick. It browns everything easily- pizza has never turned out so well for me as it does on this pan. It's done in the center, heated through completely & even, no burnt edges, no soggy bottom- just perfect. I can & do put the pans in the dishwasher- they turn out fine. I can also put the oven rack itself in the dishwasher for cleaning & sanitizing- again, no issues whatsoever. I do wash the try underneath the heating element by hand, but it's also very nonstick & even burnt-on cheese comes off with no problem, and no soaking. The tray will stain, because of the burning-on element of high heat, but it can come clean w/ Comet & a scrub sponge (don't use steel wool on it, though).<br /><br />If I had to choose between this & my big, traditional oven, I'd choose this every time!ay corn pudding, which I bake in a rectangular Polish stoneware dish.

From the minute I opened the box, this has been the easiest oven to use.  The timer for toast, pizza, and baking work well but I can easily reset temperature and time if needed.  Originally I purchased this oven as an alternative to heating up the kitchen in the summer with my regular oven.  It has ended up as my first choice when possible. I have even baked cupcakes.  Just can't say enough about this oven.  It is truly worth every penny I spent on it.  Consider purchasing the cutting board that sits on the top of the oven.  The top of the oven does get very hot and the cutting board keeps things from getting burned if inadvertently put on the top of the oven. I would also like to order the pizza stone but have not done that as of yet.<br /><br />UPDATE November of 2012.  Do I still totally love this oven - You bet.  I have used over and over and over.  Do not use the big oven so much, except for big stuff. Totally worth the money.<br /><br />UPDATE: August 2013.  Still no problems at all.  I use this oven all the time.  Very easy to use.  You will not regret the extra money for it.  Recently I purchased a Bone-Aire Durango evaporative cooler, also made in Australia.  The product is totally exceptional 5*****.  Whatever Australia is doing, I hope they continue.  They made GREAT products.<br /><br />UPDATE: August 2014.  Still no problems whatsoever.

I had one for many years that died, and replaced it with a $80 model I got at Costco. That toaster stopped heating, within a few months, but we kept on going with it.<br />This model was a real investment, as the price tag shows. I was worried about putting that much money into something that is fairly disposable, since they don't seem to last beyond a year or so now.<br />This oven has successfully passed every test I have thrown at it. I did use an oven thermometer, to check it's temperature built in. It is fairly accurate, however at the higher temps, the elements run with no cycling, so the bottom of your foods can burn. This is normal for smaller units, so no real surprise.<br />What did surprise me, is how WELL it reheats foods!! I make pancakes on the weekend, and make extras for through the week.<br />I put the pancakes in the toaster unit, on reheat, for about 3:00 minutes. I did spritz them with a little water, but that is a hold over from my old toaster. I swear, you couldn't tell that these pancakes weren't fresh!! They weren't crunchy on the outside, and soggy on the inside like before. They were moist and delicious all the way through, both blueberry and regular. It takes a full quarter sheet pan, so you can make brownies, cookies, cakes, and anything else you fancy. The fact that the wire shelf is movable, is probably half of why this cooks so well!! Fried foods can always be tricky in toaster ovens, and I generally avoid cooking them in it. The grease splatter is almost impossible to remove from the walls/top. This unit is about the same, however the nonstick interior seems to be better than most. Cleanup has been a breeze, so much so, that I clean it after every use. EVERY USE!! I have NEVER done that before!! But I wait for it to cool, use a damp cloth and most everything wipes away with one wipe.<br />Bottom line, if you have the counter top space for a larger unit, and the money to afford it, I would say this is one heck of a good deal!! It is literally like having another oven, without the cost of actually adding one!! By far, the most useful and most functional toaster oven I have ever used!!ney to afford it, I would say this is one heck of a good deal!!

I know Friday the 13th , not the best day.  Initially I was disapointed but as I use the oven it is a really great toaster oven, even though I have not made toast. The oven heats up very quickly and is large enough for a decent size meal.<br /><br />1: CORRECTION You can  set the timer for less than  10 minutes.  I incorrectly reported that you could not set the timer below 10 minutes. When you dial in the minutes the screen shows 13, 12, 11, 10.  Then the screen shows  9 : 00.  I thought it was  9  HOURS.  I was wrong.  Interesting I now believe you cannot have a time greater than 2 hours, but I do not perceive this to be a problem.<br /><br />2:  One of the things I was very disappointed with the delongi Oven toaster was the Oven door.  When the door is closed , At the top of the door there is a  GAP from the oven opening and the door.  This GAP  lets the heat JUST rise out.  SO I folded aluminum foil into a strip that I could fold around the top of the door and created a seal so heat did not come out.  It worked.  So what does this have to do the breville oven.  Well looking at all of the pictures, and videos it looks like the breville would have had a GOOD seal on the oven door to keep in the heat.... NOT SO...  THere is a good 1/16 inch GAP with the door and the oven.... Heat Just rises out of the oven door... Again folded up aluminum foil.  This sealed the door.<br /><br />3:  The electric plug has a wonderful grip on it.  But if you have a outlet on the wall, directly behind the oven, it sticks the wire out SO far that you really can't use the outlet.  The plug should  be like a FLAT plug that Keeps the wire  close to the wall.<br /><br />4: Others have mentioned the cheesy feeling of the dials. I agree but not a deal breaker.<br /><br />5:  Others have mentioned that the top of the oven gets burning HOT... Yes it does but so does the delonghi oven I have.  Seems normal.  I use small ceramic squares, as spacers, and put them on top of the oven.  On the spacers I put ceramic tiles. These tiles get hot , but not BURNING hot.ut them on top of the oven.

The multiple settings are incredibly fine tuned for almost anything you can think to make. Options for frozen and convection are beyond useful. The size is outstanding. Who wants to heat an entire oven if you are only cooking for 1-2 people.<br /><br />Please don't forget how quickly it heats up compared to a traditional ovens. It can also replace a traditional toaster, no problem. Having used over toaster ovens in the past, this is a beautiful step up. The heat is much more even, the construction much more solid, and the front ejection for the crumb tray makes cleaning a breeze.<br /><br />And there's more. On the middle setting, magnets pull the tray out a little less than half way when you open the door. This makes adding/removing food so much easier.<br /><br />If you're in the market for a toaster oven, don't waste too much time shopping around.

After about ten months of use, the convection fan started making a rattling noise, which became progressively worse over the next several weeks.  Without any hassle, Breville sent us a replacement oven shortly before the end of the one-year warranty period. We had to package and sent in the original unit using the pre-paid shipping label that  Breville provided before the replacement was sent, which is fair enough.<br /><br />The replacement oven that arrived appeared to have a defective LED screen, so we returned it to Breville for yet another replacement. Again, no hassle, except for we had to do without a toaster oven for a week or so.<br /><br />Now a new unit has arrived, and it has exactly the same problem with the LED screen.  When you look at it straight at the eye level, you can see absolutely nothing.  One must be looking at the screen at an angle in order to see what it displays.  At a side angle, the display is still rather dim.  I consulted Breville, and their very nice service representative informed me that the screen is designed to be looked at from above, and it should not be placed at the eye level.  According to the customer service representative, the original oven, purchased in 2011, had a different screen (which was very bright and could be looked at from any angle), but Breville  changed the design in 2011.  The oven shown on Amazon site has the older screen, not the new screen.<br /><br />A different oven placement is not an option in our kitchen, and this design flaw is not what you would expect from this relatively expensive toaster oven.  Given the fact that the oven that we originally purchased had to be replaced in less than a year, I can only give this toaster oven one star. I do not recommend this appliance.<br /><br />On the other hand, all the Breville customer service representatives that I spoke to were very nice, and you get to the real person very quickly if you call them on telephone.",2012-03-30

Plus your average toaster only toasts 4 slices, tight.  So I decided on getting \\""the best\\"" toaster available on Amazon.  After much research, I took a gamble at this one.  LOVE IT.  Roomy - toasts 6 slides of anything comfortably.  It's large, but honestly not as large as I thought it would be.  It doesn't come to the edge of the counter or anything so there's still some counter space in front of it.  Don't get this if you're looking for a small and cozy toaster, but it's not as gigantic as you might think.  Good size.<br /><br />So the controls are super easy.  It comes with a  massive manual (maybe 100+ pages) but honestly I don't understand why.  It's super simply.  First knob \\""chooses\\"" the type of food you're cooking - from toast to bagel to pizza to oven cuisine  to whatever.  That basically sets the minimum time to cook and tells the toaster whether to plan on using both heating elements evenly or not (for example, bagel setting doesn't use the bottom element as much as the top).  Second knob allows you to control toast-level from a 1 to 10 scale.  Where my last toaster needed to be on the lowest setting regardless or it would burn, this one is pretty accurate - use 3 or 4 for light+ toasting.  Next knob varies depending on what you're cooking - if you're toasting bread or bagels for example, it controls the number of slices (from 1 to 6).  If you're in oven mode it sets the temperature.  If you're cooking pizza it allows you to select pizza size (13\\"", 14\\"", etc.).  What this is really doing is just extending the minimum timer from the first knob to accommodate for more or larger food.  Consider this the fine-tuning knob.  Finally, there's a little button with an image of a snowflake on this.  This button is awesome because if you click it, it'll add a minute or two (whatever's appropriate) to account for the food being still frozen when you put it in the toaster.  It must also be playing with the elements because it works perfectly to thaw the food and then allow the elements to toast.  It adds maybe a minute.

To call it a toaster oven is doing it a disservice. It is so much more. I use it for almost everything. The convection oven cuts time off of heating, reheating and cooking after a long day at work. I warm and reheat without drying leftovers, including bread and rolls.  Toasting is perfection. A regular sized frozen pizza fits right in and cooks beautifully. Broiling melted cheese to top a sandwich is quick and easy. I rarely use my regular oven any more.<br /><br />If pressed to add something to the wish list for future versions I would ask for an interior light (a nice to have) and a capacitor to store the memory settings on the control pad. We have had frequent power failures lately and I have to remember my favorite broil, pizza and bake settings. Once again, not a real flaw, but would be a nice to have for a new model.",2012-03-18

My wife loves it and we now rarely use our microwave.  We had one small issue with the readout but we unplugged it and re-plugged it in and it rebooted and cleared itself.  Don't know what that was all about; no problems since.  We've had it a year and still all OK.<br /><br />We bought ours from Bed and Bath because we waited for one of their 20% off coupons which offset the sales tax and saved a little money, plus we wanted to be able to get local service if we had a problem but we haven't had any problems.  I wouldn't be afraid to buy it from Amazon now.<br /><br />NOTE: As stated, this requires its own circuit, it pulls about 1,800 watts.  We originally plugged it into the circuit our frig was on; big mistake, the frig would get flashing lights inside every time the oven ran.  It needs to be on a 20 amp circuit with the other outlets on that circuit rarely used.  Do the math: Volts x Amps = Watts so 115V x 20 Amps = 2,300 Watts, plenty to play with, but 115V x 15 Amps = 1,725 and 120V x 15 Amps = 1,800 exactly what you need so there it is.  Older homes frequently have 15 amp breakers whereas most of the newer homes have 20 amp.  Just sayin' check your breakers and plan a little.  Our electricity is supposedly 120, but it actually varies from 112 to 122 because we have a surge protector on our stereo that measures it and it's constantly varying all over the place.",2012-03-10

This is without a doubt, the best toaster oven I have ever seen anywhere!<br /><br />Most toaster ovens don't toast bread well at all.  They either toast one side and not the other, or don't toast either side well.  But the Breville isn't like most of these ovens...this one toasts bread beautifully and cooks everything quickly!  It cooks a 13 inch pizza & bakes cookies all so effortlessly!  I don't even have to turn on my regular oven anymore since I bought this one!  I hardly even use my microwave anymore as well!  I have baked just about everything I could think of, broiled and roasted chicken, beef, seafood, etc, it doesn't matter what you want to cook, everything comes out quickly, wonderfully and juicy! One of my kids favorites in the mornings is my homemade cinnamon buns... It's so nice to have this oven.  The preheat time is so quick, and then before you know it, you're food is cooked and ready to eat.<br /><br />I know it's pricey, but you do get what you pay for!  I have gone through 2 toaster ovens prior to purchasing this one and this time I said I was going to buy the best one I could find and I did!  I would recommend getting the Breville 13-Inch Pizza Crisper to go with it.  I make fresh pizza dough from my bread machine and my pizza's come out so amazing in this oven.... now my kids don't want to eat pizza anywhere else except from home!<br /><br />Buy it, you will love it!",2012-02-05

I previously had a Krups, which served me well for around 6 yrs with few problems.  Then the convection fan began sending out warning noise.  I researched for a replaceable oven.  Breville was the #1 choice.  I bought it at Bed, Bath, and Beyond with a 20% off coupon for $200.  I have had it for a month.  I examined the 0ne stars before the purchase.  Most read about similar problems, but I live within 5 miles of the Breville Customer Service Hdqts. so no problem.  I have had zero problems. I suggest that you read the excellent Instruction Book that comes with it.  Read it 2 x's.  There are many excellent tips, and warnings.<br /><br />I found that the temp. with the convection on still took longer than my old Krups, but the outcome was much better.  The Toast should have a #8.  When I toasted English Muffins #7 took about 1 min. longer.  When warming up pastry I put it in while warm up took place at 350 and timed to 1 min, and they come out perfect. I read that someone had the door shatter in their kitchen.  This is tempered glass, so don't hit it or slam it, because on heating it may shatter.  I bought the Bamboo Cutting board recommend by Amazon, the $30 one,  and it was for the 600 model.  But it is satisfactory.  The extra inch that the 800 model offered is not worth $10.  I also bought the Crisper Pizza Pan, and it is great.  I don't find the \\""noise\\"" of the warning signals neither annoying nor too loud, just right.",2012-02-03

I made myself crazy searching to no end for a product that didn't have any scarey negative reviews about temperature variations, explosions, burnt fingers and lose dials. My neighbors house had just had a fire so I was extra sensitive to any dangers of a product exploding while cooking my food! I looked around for several weeks before purchasing this unit, I was not opposed to any price point, I just wanted a product that did it's job well, was easy to clean, and looked and felt decent in quality. This was the only one I found that really caught my eye and matched all my criteria. I did purchase the cutting board to sit on top so I would be able to safely set things on top of it. We have had it about eight months now. For me, to many of these reviews are way to in depth and are focusing in on things I would never even dream of thinking about if someone didn't make an issue out of it. The primary use for mine is toasting various breads, heating frozen waffles, Toaster Strudel and reheating pizza slices. It does a fantastic job for those type of everyday jobs. It looks fantastic and the pull out tray is a breeze to clean. You really have to grab hold of the handle full hand like your getting ready to pry something open for your fingers to be in a position to burn yourself. Fingertips are only thing needed. I have toast tongs that I use to open the door and pull my bread product off the grate.  Although it has been awhile since I read through all the other reviews, I can't think of one thing negative that someone else had complained about that I have experienced.

That's two black and decker toaster ovens, one whose name I've forgot, and countless traditional toasters.  It just makes the toast perfect.  Just as much crisp as you could want (or not), and just the right amount of moisture at the center.  Heated some taco shells the other day with cheese in them and the cheese was melted but the tops were not burnt at all.  Never could get that right in the b&d's, despite their competent toasting.<br /><br />Otherwise the unit is great as others have said, packaging was excellent, unit is solid enough and aesthetically pleasing (and matches our other appliances), controls are perhaps the best that I've ever seen on a toaster oven, the included accessories are good, and the crumb tray has a nice ceramic coating on it and is really easy to remove and clean.<br /><br />The outside does get rather warm- it makes me concerned enough that we have 2-3 inches of clearance around it on all sides right now.  With all the hype around this thing I would have expected the sides to be a bit better insulated for safety's sake.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about this thing, as we were due to the cost, just buy it!

It is available at a Bed Bath and Beyond  for 20% off. The quality, functions, and ease of use are great, you will not believe all this oven is capable of. My conventional oven won't be getting much use from now on. The micro wave is getting a rest as well.

Although it was a purchase I had contemplated purchasing to consolidate and upgrade appliances, I chose to purchase William Sonoma's Cuisinart slow cooker and back ordered (March delivery) yogurt maker instead. The shipping on the slow cooker was ridiculously high, so I was glad to find it at the local store to realize that savings. I was shocked to receive a notification that the yogurt maker shipped a few days after purchasing the $200+ slow cooker. Not good for the budget, but both have worked out quite well thus far. So consider how shocked I was to also have this convection toaster oven too.<br /><br />The oven stands higher due to the rubberized feet and about 2\\"" larger in each of the dimensions than the Cuisinart Toaster oven we have enjoyed for many years now. I like having this to use for baking, roasting and toasting. The thing to keep in mind is shortening the cooking time when using the convection oven as it cooks so much faster. Although the french bread turned out a bit brown the first time out, it was tasty. However, it didn't fit well due to the length and curving the bread seemed to impact the overall cooking results. Toast and bagels turn out perfectly with a good outside crust and soft inside. The magnetic rack doesn't seem to work well on the lowest rack setting, but works ok on the higher rack settings. I love the lighted display and change in colors when cooking versus on versus sitting idle. However, I really don't understand why they went with such plastic like dials. For me it is such a detractor and feels toy like when using. The clean up for the oven is certainly easy enough as the removable crumb tray slides easily in and out.<br /><br />Overall I am quite pleased with having an appliance that can provides these various cooking methods without heating up my whole kitchen in using one or both of my regular double ovens. Especially when we experience such hot weather in Texas.

After watching what he was doing I finally ordered one with reservations-it was made by Breville.  I bought one of their expensive emersion blenders and it was soon thrown out as it never really worked.  I bought the oven from Bed Bath and Beyond as it was much less expensive.<br /><br />It arrived extremely well boxed and in great shape.  Instructions were easy enough so I just tried cooking something in it, a potatoe.  My first worry was did it really heat that fast to the dialed in temperature?  I stuck one of my smoker thermometers in it.  Nope, not near temperature yet although the signal went off.  took a  few more minutes but is seemed to go to within 8 degrees of dialed temp.  Good for me-2% off.<br /><br />Some time later I tried another potatoe as it seemed pretty good. Set temp to 375 this time.  Inserted thermometer again. Barely got to 340 degrees this time.  cranked it up to 425 and it went to 400 pretty fast. After potatoe was done I lowered temp to 300 to wait for other food to be done.  Temperature from smoker thermometer went to 300 and stayed right there, go figure.<br /><br />Well, I can live with this oven but would think they could make it a bit more accurate.  I have read other complaints on this problem too and then again many say it works very accurately.  For some reason there does not seem much consistency in manufactuing. It is a nice appliance.  Seems well built and easy to operate.  Much better than using the big oven as it doesn't heat up the whole kitchen.",2012-01-19

Even sitting four rooms away, I can smell a strong plastic/chemical smell that stays in the air for at least an hour after using the toaster. I don't know what it does to the food inside, but I am considering getting rid of the unit. It was rated very highly and we received it as a gift, but I am appalled that few of the other reviews made mention of this problem. The interior is nonstick (likely with PTFE teflon, a highly toxic substance to inhale), and repeatedly heating it emits this chemical into the air. Why would one need the entire interior surface of a toaster oven to be nonstick? It's not as if you fill the interior with anything, and reasonable people can wipe up spills as they occur. Also, the tray is supposed to slide out somehow when you open the door, but ours has never done this, so it is hard to reach inside to access food once it is done--we need to use a utensil to grab the tray and slide it out, and then the tray hits the door each time we try to close it again.

As for having no interior light, which I read some object to, one is not necessary.  On the counter top, when it's being used, you can keep an eye on what you're cooking w/o having to open the door. This is the first toaster oven that I've ever had, where the toast is actually toasted, instead of dried out.  The convection feature speeds baking & roasting, & there's no sacrifice in quality of taste or texture.  So glad I opted to go for the more expensive of toaster oven/convection; nothing yet has turned out over or under cooked.

In particular, she wanted the convection feature so quick, pickup meals could be prepared without having to resort to the microwave.  The combination of the two seems to be smart.<br /><br />So far we have just cooked meats using just the convection part.  Our impression is that the meat is jucier and more tender than even our gas oven can prepare.  Finding information on cooking time differences from regular to convection has been a little difficult.

In the short time I've had it I've used it every day, sometimes several times a day.  The only time I've used my big oven was for a large pizza.<br />It's great for warming leftover pizza slices no more damp pieces- I'll never use the microwave for that again - the pizza tastes just as good leftover as it did fresh.<br />It heats up so fast usually less than five minutes...no more waiting a half hour for my big oven to pre-heat.<br />I love that it tells me how long it will be before my toast is ready and the that the toast is so evenly browned.  It's great that it alerts when the time is up but also SHUTS OFF unlike a reagular oven.<br />I love Costco's frozen fish sticks and their egg rolls; now they cook so quickly it's easy to pull together a quick lunch.<br />Every time I turn around I find a new used for this oven,<br />I'm sorry I didn't buy one sooner.<br />The only 'con' I've encountered was in baking 9x5 loaves.  The limited height of the oven causes the dome of the loaf to be too close to the element so it browns too fast.  I did tent my loaf with foil which helped but I think I'll probably continue to bake bread in my oven.<br /><br />Edited to add:  I came beck to revise my review and remove one star due to the poor material of the drip tray.  It simply cannot be cleaned and I do think that as it loses it reflectability it causes the oven to toast less effectively and evenly.

IN fact we just bought another for our second home which is being delivered today and prompted me to give this update. This is now our \\""main\\"" oven. With just two of us there is very little reason to use the other oven, just at the holidays ir warming up a pizza if it is over 12\\"" in diameter. From toast or bagels in morning through baked potatoes for dinner and on to brownies for desert, this oven does a great job. As I mentioned in my first review my wife thought I was nuts to pay this much for a toaster oven but she loves it and was ready to get one for our second home. Trust me, the amount you spend for it will be forgotten shortly after you have started using it. Your only thought will be \\""why did I not do this sooner\\"".<br /><br />10 month update:<br />Below is the review I wrote shortly after giving my wife this oven as a Christmas present. She uses it nearly every day and when she was cooking meatloaf in it last night I asked her if she still likes it and she said she loved it. This morning there was an add on TV for a Breville coffee maker and now she wants one of those, so I guess she really does like their products. I have seen some recent reviews where the product has died after a couple of years. We have only had ours for 10 months and will continue to enjoy it and will report back if anything goes wrong.<br /><br />I gave this to my wife for Christmas. She has used it for several types of cooking so far but no broiling, yet. She absolutely loves how the toast feature works compared to her old unit and the fact that she can actually read the LCD display rather than squinting at small old fading numbers printed around the dial is another plus. I have read several reviews complaining about the unit not being at the selected temperature when the \\""ready\\"" signal goes off. Not sure if the manual has been updated recently or these folks did not read the manual but the current manual clearly says that the ready signal goes off when the oven gets to 75% of the selected temperature and that it gets hotter from there. As with all convection ovens you have to experiment with how much to reduce the temp and/or time from \\""non convection\\"" recipes. So, from my wife's perspective this unit is great. She would have never spent this kind of money for a toaster oven but now that she has it she is glad I bought it.hat the ready signal goes off when the oven gets to 75% of the selected temperature and that it gets hotter from there.

You'll probably never use your big one again!,"We've been wanting a toaster oven for a couple of years now.  We have dual Fisher & Paykel stainless ovens and while they look beautiful and work well they can take up to 20 minutes to heat up.  Sometimes we just want to cook two or three chicken fingers for our toddler, not roast a turkey.<br /><br />After reading hundreds of reviews of various products we decided on the Breville BOV800XL smart oven.  This thing is AWESOME!  You want toast, just set the toast function, tell it how many slices and range of light to dark.  BAM!  Perfect toast.  Perfect Pizza. Perfect everything.  My wife occasionally makes mexican dish that requires browning on the top.  Not only did the substantial dish fit in the oven but it browned it even better than the big oven.  Half the time to warm up, half the energy.<br /><br />There were a few issues that concerned me reading other reviews:<br />1. The Heat - Would it melt stuff around it?  Would it melt the cord?<br />2. Breaker issues - Would the breaker hold up?  Would I have to run the outlet to a separate breaker?<br />3. Counter space - Would we have enough?<br /><br />#1 I'm not going to lie, this unit gets hot.  You could seriously burn some flesh if you held your hand down on the top.  Having said that, once you know, you know and the top becomes a GREAT plate warmer.  I noticed only the top five inches of the back really gets hot so I moved the oven about six inches way from the wall so the plug is not touching the top or any part of the back.  Only the top of the sides gets really hot so I don't have to worry about the bread basket next to it catching on fire or anything.  The other side is right next to the fridge and it barely gets warm.<br /><br />#2 I have 20 amp breakers in my house.  I thought the outlet the oven is plugged into shares either the fridge or the microwave.  Neither do apparently, so I don't have to worry about that.  There are four 60 watt lights that flicker a bit when the oven is in use.  These are accent lights so I turn them off while the oven is in use just in case.  This unit is 1800 watts, that means up to 18 amps.  I would not plug a microwave into the same circuit as the oven and use them both at the same time.<br /><br />#3. Our counter is 26\\"" deep.  The oven is 16\\"" deep.  I moved the unit six inches away from the back wall so it would have clearance to breath and would not get the cord too hot.  That leaves me about 10\\"" in front.  I generally pull dishes out and to the side so the lack of space has not been an issue with me.  If your counters are not as deep (25.5\\"" is standard I think) you may want to consider placement.<br /><br />I can't tell you how much easier life is with this oven!  Food cooks faster, and the timer turns the oven OFF, just in case you forget about it.  The smart settings are flawless.  Buy the pizza crisper too.  It works great.<br />An added bonus is that the oven is out of reach of my toddler (for now) so cooking becomes safer.  Yes, it is a LOT of money for a toaster oven, but just think of it as an energy efficient replacement for your main oven, because that is what it is!<br /><br />(Follow up 1/2/2013)<br />After nearly a year of use we still LOVE our Breville oven.  We use it 90% of the time over our conventional double ovens.  I would like to follow up with the power requirements.  When on BROIL or other setting with temps over 400 degrees the Breville kicks into another gear.  When I have the toaster oven and the Microwave going at the same time it trips the breaker.

I read all the reviews and some of the bad ones are concerning to me (i.e. the LCD dying or the heating elements burning out in less than a year etc.). I've only had it for a few days and plan to update again in a few months but did want to give my assessment so far. Although I have a really tiny kitchen, I made space for the non-compact version of this oven primarily because of the volume. I have the ability to cook small casseroles or bake small quantities if I desire which the smaller oven didn't seem like it could (volume wise). Comparing the two side by side, the regular size really isn't THAT much larger than the 'compact' version.<br /><br />Specific Pros for me:<br />- Heats up FAST! I don't think I'll be using my regular oven very often anymore (and it's an old oven anyway.<br />- Volume is generous i.e. it is able to hold small casserole dishes and even a pizza. Haven't tried the pizza yet but the casseroles made to date have come out delicious as if made in a regular oven.<br />- Beautifully designed externally. The knobs are very intuitive and the controls are easy to learn even if you're not technologically savvy.<br />- Auto ejects the wire rack for certain settings which for anyone who's ever burned their arm taking something out the oven, this is a nice thought by the engineers.<br /><br />specific Cons for me:<br />- As beautiful as the exterior is, the finish is too darn sensitive for cleaning. Everything I touch the surfaces with seems to leave scratches (sad face) and I'm being extremely gentle with this device after paying this much for it.<br />- Short power cord. Seriously? It's like 2 ft long. This really annoyed me as my kitchen is very small and has few outlets. I didn't want to run extension cords around the stove so I had to re-arrange my entire counter top to accommodate the oven.<br />- If the oven is in stand-by, it doesn't respond right away when you turn the dials. It takes a few turns before it 'wakes up'. However I figured out a way that works better and I don't believe it was in the manual. If the oven is in stand-by, touch the Start/Cancel button and it will immediately wake up the machine (but not turn it on). The dials respond right away after that.<br /><br />Overall, the pros seem to out-weigh the cons for the moment. I haven't had to deal with customer service yet and hoping I don't have to.

But my wife bought a middle-of-the-road brand-name toaster oven. I tolerated it for years, although it made lousy toast, and heated very unevenly. I purchased this unit in the hope of getting good toast again, but got much more. The oven is big enough to bake a pizza or roast a chicken, but takes up little more counter space than its lousy predecessor--which could not accommodate anything with a footprint bigger than a sheet of letterhead, nor taller than about three inches. I have not cooked anything that spatters yet, but anticipate cleanup will be reasonably easy.

The fix is to let it warm up with convection off, put in the food and then turn on convection. This doesn't seem to be unique to my oven based on other comments on the net.<br /><br />Also there's a 2 hour limit on the cooking time.

It cooked a crab dip for New Year's Eve. It made toast and bagels for a house full of people the morning of New Year's day. And it reheated leftovers later on New Year's day.  So far, it's worked flawlessly.<br /><br />The controls were a bit of a concern when I first took it out of the box.  I should state up front that my wife is a severe technophobe.  She hates technology and the general complexity of consumer products these days.  So when I plopped the Breville on our kitchen counter and she got a look at the LCD display, she started backing away instinctively thinking that this was yet another appliance that required a couple hours of reading a boring product manual.  Once she actually played with the four controls (food selection, temp, time, start/stop) she got it almost immediately.  She relaxed once she realized that this thing's controls are \\""Apple\\"" simple.  You dont need to open the manual to know how to use this Breville toaster oven.  Even the kids were able to look at the controls for about 30 seconds and figure it out completely.  And that's how consumer products should be designed.  So it's really simple and it really works.<br /><br />What about construction?  Well unlike cheaper toaster ovens that use stamped mild steel and black paint, the Breville body is made from a stamped sheet of real stainless steel.  So there won't be any peeling paint in a few years.  And the handle is a massive stainless affair that doesn't work any better than a cheaper handle but looks much better.  And it's well designed to stand off from the hot oven so you won't burn your hand.  The oven door has magnets embedded out of sight so that as you lower the door, the rack is pulled out a few inches so you don't have to reach into the oven to grab a piece of toast and risk burning a hand.  As for the heating elements, the Breville uses the same metal resistance coils encased in glass tubing that almost every toaster oven uses.  But whereas most competitors use four of these heating elements, the Breville adds a fifth element (top center) along with a heat diffuser.  In addition to the increased heat output, the product designers at Breville have developed logic to cycle the various elements on and off depending upon what task the oven is asked to accomplish in order to cook food more evenly and faster.  Lastly, the Breville uses a convection fan like many of its competitors to distribute heat evenly but in this unit the fan is almost silent.  That's another nice quality touch that makes life a little better.<br /><br />All things considered, we're impressed with the Breville despite it's substantially higher price than most of the competition.  For us anyway, I think the price is justified based on the materials quality, excellent design, and cooking performance.of toast and risk burning a hand.

Use it with care always.<br /><br />I called customer service on Dec. 26th and I have to send the unit back to them. I was afraid that warranty would not have covered it, but apparently they do and although it is a rare problem, it can happen! Was told that it will take 2 weeks to repair my oven and another week or so to be returned back to me. So all in all, about 3-4 weeks without an oven!

In retrospect, I have to wonder how many of those people were compensated endorsers.  I admit to having my suspicions about some of the claims that were being made about how well this oven performed, but I went ahead and spent the premium price on this glorified toaster oven.<br /><br />First off, anyone who seriously claims that this thing works better than their home oven would have been better served to spend their $250 towards upgrading their home oven instead of purchasing this product, because their home oven obviously is a total piece of junk.  Let's start with a simple, undeniable fact:  With an oven, size DOES matter.  Since the Breville is a toaster oven, you're working with a much smaller chamber size than a large oven.  Why is that important?  Answer: Heat circulation and proximity to the cooking elements.  When you put something like a 12\\"" pizza or 9x13\\"" baking pan in the oven, you're severely restricting the oven's heat circulation.  Using pizza as an example, I've found (through repeated testing with and without convection) that the heat rolling around the edges of the pizza significantly browns the outer portion before the cheese in the center is anywhere near done.  This is not acceptable and reflects poor heat circulation.  This is also not a problem with my home oven, due to its larger chamber size and better circulation.  In addition, the crust turns out far, far better in my home oven than on the Breville--so much so that it isn't even close.<br /><br />What about bread?  Other reviewers rave about the bread-making capabilities of the Breville.  I have not found this to be the case.  Once again, the Breville is limited by the size of its cooking chamber.  If you're baking a full-sized loaf of bread, you'll find that the top of the bread is precariously close to the upper heating elements.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what happens next.  Before I get accused of overcooking the bread, I should point out that I use a $90 instant-read Thermapen to test the bread's internal temperature to determine if it is done.  If the cooking chamber were larger, the bread wouldn't be so close to the cooking elements, and the top of the bread would not get too brown.<br /><br />This oven is a decent toaster with some rudimentary oven capabilities and nothing more.  The electronic controls are clearly done with marketing more in mind rather than useful functionality.  (Are functions like the pizza size indicator REALLY necessary other than to set an arbitrary cooking time?) Unlike a conventional oven, it is not insulated, meaning that it wastes energy and gets extremely hot on the outside.  As a result, it needs plenty of room around it when in use, and please don't put anything on top of it while baking.  Is it a decent toaster with limited baking capabilities?  Yes.  Was it worth $250?  Certainly not, but if you like pretty digital displays and countdown timers with limited cooking value, by all means go for it.  It is your money.sed of overcooking the bread, I should point out that I use a $90 instant-read Thermapen to test the bread's internal temperature to determine if it is done.

So, what do I get now?  I bought a cheap one at a store but I soon saw it wasn't very good.  Then I researched on Amazon, came across this, and it's been wonderful.

After reading the reviews of the Breville Smart Oven I decided to bite the bullet on the cost and purchase it.  I have not been disappointed.  In the three months I've owned it, I've baked chicken, broiled fish and hamburgers, baked cornbread, and even as I write this, I have gingerbread baking in it right now.  I use it every morning to make my toast which, after a few tries to find the right setting for my type of bread, toasts it to perfection (as long as you don't mind grill lines on one side of your bread from the wire rack).

It's on the same circuit as my microwave, and I can't operate both at the same time without tripping the circuit breaker.

After only a few weeks I realized I could never go back to not-owning a countertop convection oven. However, believe me, you are gambling when you buy this due to numerous seemingly common failures.<br /><br />I bought my oven over a year ago, after only 3-4 months of light/medium duty use, the convection fan starting creaking and squeaking. At first not so bad, but another month later it was so loud I would describe it as unusable with the fan.  I called Breville. They told me to take it back to williams-sonoma so I did. WS gave me a new one, great right?<br /><br />After about 4 months the blue control panel back light started working intermittently on the replacement oven.  I didn't think much of it initially since I thought I could replace a bulb or something. It eventually completely failed and would not come back on. This may not sound like a big deal, however, like most people, we have this under a cabinet where there is limited light and the panel is EXTERMELY difficult to read without the backlight. I ended up having to stoop and bend over to put my eye within 6 inches of it everytime I wanted to use. After a couple months of this I finally had enough. I called breville, they said no problem, it's not fixable and they'll send me out a replacement and just fax a copy of my receipt.  I couldn't find my receipt (my fault i'm sure i misplaced it after digging it out to get the replacement oven) so went back to william sonoma  to see if they could print it out, no they couldn't, but the very helpful woman there said I could just bring the defective oven and they'd replace it.<br /><br />Great, get home with the 3rd oven...it acted like it was working but it wasn't getting hot! No heat whatsoever, ever. Tried to go through the intial setup 3x, never heated once!<br /><br />So, back to WS and they gave me another replacement....now my 4th oven(!) So far so good but it's only been 1 month.<br /><br />Clearly Breville has some problems with the quality control of this oven. Google \\""Breville blue light\\"" or \\""Breville fan noise\\"" and you'll find dozens and dozens of people who bought this oven and weren't as lucky as me in getting warranty replacements.<br /><br />The morals, first, unless you like gambling look at another brand, I see there are some new, nice looking stainless ovens on the market from reputable companies.

As others have experienced, the 1800 watts when added to another running appliance can trip a breaker. This is such that I cannot make toast and brew coffee at the same time...! This high energy usage appears necessary because of the poor insulation of the top of the oven. Unlike some others, I have no interest in using this waste heat to warm plates. This lack of insulation is a disgrace in this day and age of energy usage awareness.<br /><br />So be warned, with this toaster oven, you are also getting a \\""space heater\\"" and a higher than need be energy bill.

The brand is excellent and we love the features.<br /><br />Pros: You set the oven to what you would like to do, such as Toast, Bagel, Bake, Roast, Broil, Pizza, Cookies, Reheat, or Warm.  Each one of these choices has pre-set time and temperatures, you can adjust as necessary for what you are cooking/warming.  The toast comes out wonderful, much better than our $50.00 toaster and the oven cooks great cakes, a little quicker and better than our normal gas oven.  We have cooked pizzas, tacos, corn dogs, you name it, if it fits we use this oven over our normal oven.  It is so much easier and quicker.  The oven will fit most frozen pizzas that are in the grocers frozen food aisle, just not the overly large ones, ones that are over 13\\"".  We love that the oven turns itself off when it is done cooking, great energy saver and keeps from over cooking as well.  It features a system that keep the oven at the precise temperature by regulating the heating elements as you are cooking.<br /><br />Cons: The unit beeps every time you plug in into an outlet.  Slightly annoying, but not enough to lower my rating by a star.  We have a small child and there is some concern of this beep waking him up.<br /><br />Overall:  I highly recommend the oven over many other ovens.  There are better priced ones that will work probably just as fine as this, but we wanted to purchase an oven that would last.  That is to be seen, but I'll keep this in mind and adjust my review as necessary.",2011-11-29

We looked high and low and narrowed our search to four different models. While trying to decide between them, we happened across the Breville 800XL on Amazon, which we hadn't even heard of before that point. There were a few hundred reviews then, nearly all of them glowingly positive. After reading them, we tossed out our four previous front runners and decided to go with the Breville 800XL. We've never been sorry we did.<br /><br />We bake bread in it. We make pizza in it. We toast things in it. It is a workhorse! It cooks amazingly evenly, and we've been very happy with the results no matter what we've tried. Some reviewers mentioned that you can't use aluminum foil in it. You can, just be sure it doesn't touch the elements. We have had this oven for several months now, and are just as happy as the week we bought it.<br /><br />The magnetic pull-out feature of the rack in the middle position is very handy, and helps when removing hot items after cooking. It has a fairly large capacity for a toaster oven, which is great. If it was big enough to hold a full-size cookie sheet (which it isn't), I think I'd never use my large oven at all.<br /><br />Bravo, Breville!",2011-11-23

However, I do have enough information to rebut one key negative noted in a few of the reviews here - temperature accuracy.  Although the large majority of reviews on Amazon are very positive, a repeating lament is a low actual temperature.  We nearly decided to go with another brand based on those reviews.  I'm glad we didn't.<br /><br />For testing, I used an iGrill (Bluetooth remote temperature gauge), which we've tested and found to be highly accurate vs our Thermapen.  We set the oven to simple bake at 350 degrees.  The preheat cycle started and within four minutes beeped.  The oven was at 332 degrees.  However, in less than a minute it had reached exactly 350.  Left at that setting, it held 351 degrees, never wavering more than 1 degree in either direction.  A similar test at 400 degrees had the same results, with a final temperature of 402 degrees, plus or minus 1 degree held.<br /><br />The oven seems to signal the end of the preheating when the heating elements cease full power and cycle down to approach the final temperature, which again is reached in less than a minute after the beep.  In practical usage, this means by the time you grab your cookies and get to the oven, the temperature will likely be spot-on.<br /><br />Actual cooking tests so far have been toast (perfect), and a broiled tomato and cheese sandwich (excellent).<br /><br />I do have some minor nits of my own to pick: The top (broil) rack setting is quite high - a thick steak or even a thick sandwich is pretty close to the burner.  I used the middle rack placement to broil the sandwich.  As expected, this took a bit longer to crisp the cheese.  A minor nit.<br /><br />Secondly, the top and (especially) face of the oven get quite hot (as in \\""painful burn\\"" hot), so mind the warning sticker and don't touch!

The Cuisinart had the same problem as this oven, a non-stick coating on the crumb tray (that had to be removed from the back or this massive oven!) that was non-stick, but only for crumbs from toast! When I wanted another one from Cuisinart, they had none for sale. Why, the oven was discontinued and they were out of them. No surprise.<br /><br />After treating my Breville crumb tray delicately and not being able to get even minor grease drips off, I called Breville and they sent me a new one at no cost. I have seen where people have put non-stick pads on top of their non-stick crumb tray, Does this makes sense to anyone? These people must put clear plastic covers on their sofas and chairs. Here's my simple solution:<br /><br />Unscrew the main tray from the handle (or not, if you are careful). Sand off all of the non-stick coating with 220 grit wet/dry sandpaper and then a 400 grit. Take your time, use it wet in the sink. Reattach the crumb tray. Now you have a bare metal stainless steel crumb tray and toast crumbs will brush off just as if it had a coating. When you get nasty stuff on it, grab the Brillo Pad or copper scrubber and you will have it clean in no time.<br /><br />By the way, the coating on the baking pan so thin it is also useless. Touch it with the copper scrubber and it's gone. Why would I want this stuff getting stuck to my food? Don't suggest foil or a spray, those should not be necessary in a non-stick pan and if they are, what's with the non-stick coating? It's more difficult to remove, but I will be doing it, or I will find a stainless one that fits in the oven.<br /><br />The oven still gets five stars because it is fantastic.",2011-10-25

Based soley on the other product reviews on Amazon and as a surprise for my wife, I took a chance and purchased this oven without discussing it with her. She has a particular preference for certain appliance brands such as Sub-Zero, Wolf, Viking, Lynx so I knew this was a risky decision. (Hint to the men for Christmas).<br /><br />I opened the package one night and left it on the countertop without any directions. Both my wife and 11 year old started using the oven the next morning which they found to be so intuitive and simple. The best features are the automatic settings for any type of food (so no need to monitor the oven or guess how much time or what temperature is needed for each type of food), speed and quality of the heating element, and easy front removal of the crumb tray. As other's have commented, the toast and bagels come out crispy on the outside but moist and soft on the inside. Same for cookies and waffles. The top of the oven can also be used as a warming tray. We have also re-heated various foods such as pasta, steaks, fish, french fries etc on the included and easy to clean trays, without any drying out of the food. As a result of this purchase, we no longer use our main oven and the food taste much better. This product has simplied our lives and made cooking so much more convenient.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Breville is the BMW of toaster ovens and well worth the extra dollars for this quality product!",2011-10-21

I was impressed with Amazon's reviews, and for the most part, I'm impressed with this little oven. In the month  I've had it, it fits well under the cupboards, came with 3 high-quality pans that fit (Cuisinart's seemed to self-destruct after 18 mo. or so and the cost to order separately was ridiculous. Also size of their oven was just a notch smaller than most other non-Cuisinart pans).<br /><br />The range of cooking options  are perfect for two people who rely, primarily, on a smaller oven for most of their meals. I did not read, perhaps missed it in 600+ reviews, that this little model is HOT! If you're used to reaching INTO the oven to pull out the pan without serious gloves (covering up to the elbow), be sure you have a pair of those serious gloves before using this oven. Otherwise, there is some sensation of a burn, although not any obvious reddening or blistering, for just putting your hands inside it. I have a large GE convection oven that is not this intense and never had the experience with any other oven. In my learning phase, I used aloe vera afterward several times a day for a couple of days for just quickly reaching inside.<br /><br />That said, I do wish ALL of the racks rolled out, only the middle one does. And it's surprising that on \\""broil\\"" - the door is closed. Yet, it cooks perfectly. I've tried bacon, pizza, casseroles, muffins, and burgers and they all turned out great. So I'd give 5 stars to performance, but less for the danger of burns. The manual and oven stickers say \\""It's hot\\"" and they mean it. So, go ahead and get this one, but be sure that you also order up to the elbow gloves.<br /><br />It also seems that most other toaster-type models were impossible to clean. On that topic, I'd rate this one 5 stars. Not only does it stay cleaner (somehow), but spills do not stick to the walls or racks. That was a nice surprise!",2011-10-18

Nice crisp crust, browned a bit on top, yummy.  It bakes tasty cinnamon buns.  It does a great job on toast -- nice and browned on the outside, warm in the middle.

The only drawback<br />is that I can't put a large casserole dish in the oven.",2011-10-03

So we called breville  and asked for a discount on a second oven due to the defect in the first and hit the first line of least trained and limited agent who could of course do nothing so asked to move up to management who asked for a picture  of the damage and invoice which we emailed them and then offered to send out another for 199 inc shipping which we gladly accepted so now we have two and love them (by the way as an electronic eng who studied and worked in microwave field I would not feed a dog micro waved food and I very much a cat person)<br /><br />apr 2012 update both oven are working just fine and cook wonderfuly in fact cook faster then recomeded directions by 10%,2011-10-01

I totally agree with the complaints of others here saying it is not properly calibrated. I know mine never has been.  However, I've learned to cope with this by using an accurate, stand alone oven thermometer.<br /><br />I place it inside the oven, in the center of the rack, from the start to make sure it gets up to the temperature needed. If possible, I leave the thermometer in there for the entire time and check it every 10 minutes to make sure it's staying at the necessary temperature. However, usually, I have to remove it in order for the pan or other item to go in. I've found that when the beeper goes off saying it's reached the desired temperature, I have to wait another 5-10 minutes for the thermometer to read the temp I set the oven to.<br /><br />Sometimes, I have to extend the cooking time for foods to be thoroughly cooked.<br /><br />When toasting, I put the darkness level up to 6 and set the quantity to the correct amount (i.e. 2 for 2 slices of bread).<br /><br />When broiling, I stay close by to monitor whatever I'm broiling as it might take a minute or two more than I expect it to. Or, it could take less time. I've burned a few things by not being watchful.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Looks nice.<br />2. Burners are not exposed on the bottom.<br />3. Easy to clean with it's pull out crumb catcher tray.<br />4. Interior size.<br />5. The accessories it came with. I really like the pizza pan and use it for much more than pizza.<br />6. Fairly easy to use, once you figure out it's quirks.<br />7. Adjustable interior rack.<br />8. Magnets in the door that pull out the rack when you open it (however, this only works when the rack is in the center position).<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. It takes a long time to toast bread (as most toaster ovens do) and the toasting is not always even.<br />2. It takes longer to cook things than expected, even when using the convection setting.<br />3. There are 'hot spots' - confirmed by using an oven thermometer moved around inside, over the course of an hour, but suing the convection setting can offset that.<br />4. The temperature that you set it to is not what it really gets to. It's too low by 25-50'. I confirmed it with the oven thermometer and a food thermometer (see #3).<br />5. Food is not consistently cooked throughout if not left in longer or set to higher temperature. Make sure you check your food, especially if cooking frozen meals and anything with meat. My homemade cookies and zucchini bread both came out underdone. Will have to figure out the proper adjustments for every dish when I use this oven to bake in. Experimentation is not a dirty word, just an annoyance.<br />6. Can't put/cook with anything in a glass Pyrex dish, which are made for baking in. Not sure why this is though. Ok, I have used one in the oven since originally writing this, and nothing bad happened.<br />7. No interior light.<br />8. It's hot on the top!<br /><br />Considering how poorly made most all toaster ovens seem to be in the past 20 years, likely because most are made in China where it's all about quantity and not quality, I don't see the point of exchanging it for another one, or another make and model. If it lasts me 5 years without any other major complaints, such as digital pad fading out or a burner going bad, I'll be satisfied. I just wish that for the money I paid for it, it would work as it's supposed to.ur, but suing the convection setting can offset that. 4.

I wasn't expecting to see much difference in performance, but one of the heating elements was starting to fail in my old oven and it definitely had seen better days. I did extensive online research over a period of several months before deciding on this particular oven. Its larger interior size gives me more options in terms of pan sizes, and the increased wattage means it preheats quickly. I opted to buy the wooden cutting board top, and I highly recommend it. I don't store anything on top of my oven, but I've found the cutting board (with a small cooling rack on top) is the perfect place to put hot pans right out of the oven. I think on its own the stainless steel top would become scratched if used this way.<br /><br />I've been more than pleased with the oven's performance. Everything I've used it for has turned out quite well. I've baked at least 20 loaves of different kinds of bread, as well as buns, rolls, cupcakes, coffee cakes, cinnamon rolls, cookies, cakes, roasted vegetables, broiled meat and fish, and lots of toast. I could not be happier with the results.<br /><br />My only concern so far is that the broiling pan and insert that came with the oven appear to be either irregulars or seconds; that's the only reason I did not give the product a five star rating. After hand-washing them several times because I thought they weren't clean, I examined them more closely and discovered there are inherent flaws in their nonstick surface, which will likely become problematic over time. I'm hoping that doesn't mean the toaster oven itself was a second or irregular. I've never had that happen before with Amazon.com, so I'm hoping it's an anomaly that is limited to the pans themselves.",2011-09-24

Our first oven failed at 22 months.  After much haggling with Breville, they agreed to send us a rebuilt unit.  Well, the second unit didn't make it past 18 months.  We have never used these units heavily, but... the first one just started displaying error codes and the unit became completely dysfunctional.  Our second unit now has serious issues with the control panel knobs and buttons.  They are difficult to turn and/or push.  It's clearly on its way out, so I'm shopping for a different brand.  I feel like a schmuck for paying big bucks to acquire this item.  No way is it worth it.<br /><br />** Original Review September 2011**<br />We purchased this oven almost three months ago and have used it regularly.  I never thought I would pay $250 for a toaster oven, but other reviews convinced us it was the way to go.  It's also much more than just a toaster oven.  The size is absolutely great, making it far more useful than a run of the mill toaster oven.  We can fit a 13x9 cake pan or a full 1/4 sheet pan in the oven.  It is used frequently for everything from warming pizza to cooking meatloaf for dinner.  It heats up fast and uses much less electricity than a conventional oven.  We always host the family's thanksgiving dinner and invariably have one casserole dish that won't fit in the oven.  It has to compete with the turkey and then the sheets of homemade biscuits.  Consider that problem solved.<br /><br />Oh, and did I mention you can also make toast in it?  It will indeed toast 6 slices of bread, but ONLY if they are on the small side.  Any bread that is the least bit large and 6 slices won't fit.  OTOH, I don't remember having much of a need to toast more than 4 slices at a time.<br /><br />The adjustable rack is excellent.  Lower for baking, middle for toast and upper for broiling.  It slides in and out easily.  I would urge caution though in that you should never grab the rack shortly after your wife has made toast without your knowledge.  Dang that was hot.  The only function we have not used is the broiler, but we just don't broil food to speak of.  With regard to every other function, it performs flawlessly.  It even displays a countdown timer so you know when it plans to be done toasting your bread or baking your pot pies.<br /><br />The oven is well built and the crumb tray cleans easily.  It has excellent controls and provides a lot of built in settings to choose from.  Check the dimensions and if you find it will fit in the space available, I highly recommend a purchase.<br /><br />** Update 04/22/13 **<br />Well, sad to say that this oven didn't even make it to its 2 year anniversary at our house.

I have had this over a year, and it still seems to work well.  I rarely use my big oven anymore.  I can make muffins, homemade breads and rolls, casseroles, cakes, and pretty much anything.  I bought this because you can use a 13x9 pan (without handles- I have an old aluminum one I use) in it.  And it is tall enough to bake bread in a bread pan, as well.  This cooks better than my oven, actually.  It browns baked goods more evenly.  It doesn't heat up my kitchen in the summer, and takes a few minutes to heat up as opposed to triple that in the big oven. Another great thing to mention is that your oven uses so much more electricity.  I have read that the typical oven uses 4000-9000 watts (my own says 10500!), as opposed to the 1800 this uses. This is a product I love and totally recommend to anyone, whether you are cooking for one or six (like me!)",2011-09-02

We also do not have a microwave.  Our regular oven is gas.  When it first arrived, we were initially taken aback by the size.  Larger than we had imagined and been used to, but soon overcame that hesitancy.  We have fluorescents under the counter and it seems that when it is on everything but toast, the lights will flicker a little.  Seems to be the nature of the beast.  Even had an electrician come out and check out our circuits.  Everything fine.  Think it might be a result of their Element IQ which handles the heating elements.<br /><br />Large enough to do more than toast and warm up. Though even the toast cycle is not ordinary: crisp on the outside and softer on the inside.  Good capacity and saves us from having to heat up our large regular oven for the smaller and  normal casserole, potatoes etc..  Don't have to cook a lot at once to conserve energy.  Quite versatile and controls are easy to use and intuitive.  Check out their site and their video.  Quite impressed with their ingenuity.  This is a SMART oven.  It does not just turn on and off to control the heat.  It is their way of using the heating elements that keeps such a steady heat. Liked the convection oven option.  Love the \\""thumb\\"" hole in plug head to remove  from socket easily. Three-pronged plug. The crumb tray pulls out in front and so you no longer have to turn the oven around to remove and  clean.  Toaster rack slides out using magnets so that you don't have to use hot pads or reach back with a fork to slide your toast out. Sturdy, well built,  and a great combo of function and design<br /><br />If you like form and function,  this is worth the money.  This became more than a replacement.

I had never used a convection oven, but I have friends who think they are great.  I took the plunge and spent the big money on this machine.  So far I am thrilled.  It makes great toast and the oven is perfect for us. I can make a pie in it without heating up the entire kitchen.  It will be great for holidays, too. It's always nice to have an extra oven.  Needless to say, it is much larger than my former toaster oven, but I'm okay with that.  The amount of counter space it takes is considerable, but I have to remember it is an oven.  That means it really is.  My old toaster oven was supposed to be an oven, too, but this is for real. I'm very pleased that I spent the $ on this.  In these times it is hard to do that, but I believe I got a valuable tool that will be used much more than a toaster alone.  It is very simple to use, too.

Over a short amount of time, I started having trouble with the controls and rotating the knob to select the cooking options (bake, broil, etc) ended up with the display over shooting where I dialed it...same as the time.  I would cook an item and have a few minutes left...I would rotate the time knob to add more time and the time would jump all over the place and sometimes it took a while to get it to land where I wanted it.  Eventually the controls got worse and it would flash and beep or the convection setting would just randomly come on or off and then the display just quit working.  Im looking at another brandall.  There is no extra heat in the kitchen and I am using a lot less power than I would with a full size oven.  I even find myself doing healthier deserts, like slicing an apple and baking it with some cinnamon.  I was also amazed at how good vegetables taste when sprayed with a little olive oil and minimal seasoning and baked in the oven.  I am definitely eating a lot healthier now and eating a lot more vegetables.  I should have done this a long time ago...    This oven is great and I see why.  I read reports where other toaster ovens were tested and some were off as much as 60 degrees from what was dialed in.  Also, cheap ovens do not have consistent temperature.  I noticed my old one would cycle off and on a lot and no wonder the fries were burnt on the ouside and raw in the middle.  Everything turns out perfect in this oven.  The heating elements are different and I can tell that they are way more efficient and effective than the elements in the cheaper ovens.  The electronics that control the oven are also very good.  All the toater ovens I had in the past were where I selected one of three settings and then dialed in a time and I got whatever was there when the dinger went off.

We had been using a far smaller toaster oven Black & Decker Toast-R-Oven that costs $30.  The new toaster costs between $250 and $300.<br /><br />One thing to point out - this is a large toaster - the above photo shows it next to a 5 quart stand mixer for comparison.  If you don't have enough room, I would not recommend this.  I would not have wanted this when I was living in an apartment on campus.  As mentioned below, we had to send it back to the manufacturer for replacement, and our kitchen felt much larger during the week it was gone.<br /><br />The toaster comes with one wire rack (there are three different levels you can put the rack depending on what you are cooking), a 13\\"" circular pizza pan, and a 12\\""x\\""12\\"" roasting tray with drip tray.  You can buy more of these if you want, as well as a perforated pizza pan and a pizza stone.<br /><br />The toaster is listed at 1800 watts, so make sure that your circuit can handle 15 amps - most household circuits today are 20 amps, but older houses may not.  Most functions only pull 1500 watts, the toast and bagel function use the full 1800.<br /><br />There are nine different cook functions (toast, bagel, bake, roast, broil, pizza, cookies, reheat, warm).  You can also manually turn the convection fan on and off (although some functions such as toast and bagel don't allow it to be turned on).  Additionally, there is a button for \\""frozen\\"", which as far as I can tell just adds some extra time to the timer.  We pretty much use bake, toast and bagel for almost everything.<br /><br />It's large enough to fit a 13 x 9 roasting pan we already had, which we actually use more than the included tray.  We've used this roasting pan to cook split chicken breasts.  The oven is not tall enough to cook a small chicken, although I'd imagine that a Cornish game hen or other small poultry would fit.<br /><br />All store bought frozen pizzas we've purchased fit.  The pizza tray is 13\\"" round (about 12.5\\"" of cooking space given that it has crimped edges), so anything that can fit on that should be good to go.<br /><br />The toaster comes with a 1 year warranty, which seems pretty short for a $300 toaster; however, I had good luck getting a failing unit replaced out of my warranty period.<br /><br />After about 14 months, the LCD screen on the toaster started to become very faint and hard to read.  I contacted Breville through their customer service site ([...]  Even though my unit was two months out of warranty and I had lost the receipt, they replaced my unit at no cost to me - they even paid for shipping both ways.  I was only out of a toaster for about a week total.  The new unit has slightly different backlighting on the LCD screen (more white than blue; reading the customer service website led me to believe that other people where having these same problems) and there are also small clips that help prevent the wire rack from sliding out of the toaster (see photo below).<br /><br />Regarding energy savings using a toaster oven vs a full size oven:<br /><br />1) If you have a gas oven, the toaster may use more energy than the gas oven.  During the summer months, our gas bills normally shows that we use 2 therms of gas, for both our stove top, oven and dryer; gas runs us about $1.50 a therm.<br /><br />2) While a small toaster oven will put off less heat than a full oven, we have a hood above our stove that vents hot air outside.

We normally have this on in the summer months when we cook.  Of course, venting air outside causes warm outside are to come into the house when we open a door or window.  Since we keep the toaster is off to the side on the counter, all the heat generated stays in the kitchen.",2011-07-30

It is a excellent toaster oven, etc, but their customer service and warranty are terrible.<br /><br />Here is a summary of the situation:<br />- It is probably a blown fuse, but if I open the back of the unit then the warranty is void.<br />- If I take it to an approved service center I have to pay for the repair, not Breville.<br />- I can send it back to Breville and get a new one - however, a new warranty does not start with the replacement unit, the warranty stays with the Feb 5, 2011 purchase date, so if an issue happens on the new one in 6 months I'm stuck.<br />- They provide a shipping label for FedEx for the return, but you have to pay for any packing costs<br />- I asked if they could send a new one right away with shipment confirmation for FedEx because I am having a huge event at my house and need the oven, they said it required management approval, get this, the manager is on vacation and their is no one else who can authorize sending out a new one before receiving the old one!!  No one, and how big is this company??<br />- Amazon cannot do anything about it because it is after the 30 day Amazon warranty, but Breville asked me to go to Amazon to request a refund, Hmmmm, ya think Breville would know Amazon's policy??<br /><br />Yes, I am frustrated and it shows.

The video and reviews sold me on the Breville, which has far exceeded my expectations.  For just the two of us, it's nice for smaller meal prep but since family celebrations are often at our home, it's also very handy when cooking for a crowd.  It does a great job on everything I've thrown at it so far including breads, casseroles, broiled meats.  Oh, yes, it even makes great toast; we especially like garlic toast made with steak buns. It cooks evenly, silently, and doesn't heat up the house.  Cook settings are easily adjusted and the lighted panel is easy to read.  When placed for toast, the rack slides part-way out when the door is opened.  This very slick feature is also useful when broiling....meats cook nicely at that level and the popout shelf makes it easy to turn the food.  Cleanup is a breeze, even the broiler pan (just like a regular oven broiler, a little water in the pan will eliminate splatter).  It's such fun, I'm going to buy a toaster oven cookbook.  I would recommend the Breville to anyone.  This thing is worth every penny!<br /><br />update Jan 21, 2015 - 3 1/2 years later, I'm still loving this Breville oven.  I use it frequently and it handles our baking and broiling needs very nicely. I like the fact that one can set the cooking time and the oven shuts itself off when it's done.  The only time our big oven sees any action is when I need the space for extra holiday dinner casseroles or for baking cookies en masse on standard cookie sheets.  Overall, the Breville is a very handy and efficient appliance, meal preparation seems like less work and a lot more fun since we bought it.",2011-07-20

Amazing oven but no interior light?,"Oh if it only had a light inside of the oven! I love this oven so much there has hardly been a day when we didn't use it since it arrived last month. I also picked up an induction cook top so it seems that my gas oven/range  has been rendered obsolete.<br /><br />If you get this oven remember that the front gets very very hot and the top is a 15 minute plate warmer. I'd say to buy the custom cutting board that goes on top from amazon and 2 additional wire racks from an external website. The racks will come in handy when you're doing brownies or baked chicken or fish fingers in volume. The actual cook space maximum inside the oven in inches is 5 high, 13 long and 10 wide. So far I've been decreasing regular recopies by 25F and cook time I decrease by 10%. So if a certain baked something reads 450f for 30 minutes, I'll go 425f for 27 minutes and get perfect bread. There are great benefits to leaving the gas burning combo box - The first thing you'll notice is that you will smell only the food you are cooking. Think about it, would you sit in your garage with your car running?<br /><br />I am disappointed that there is no light inside the Breville oven and that there is no cover offered for it. It would be really nice if it had at least one light inside so that I didn't have to use a flashlight, came with a cover, 2 more wire racks and a hard-case or even a soft pouch to keep all of the accessories in. It would also be nice if Breville made covers for all of their other machines too - The Pie Maker, the Stand Mixer, Blenders, the Ovens - I'd like really nice covers that say Breville in chrome or fake diamonds.

Breville's customer support, whether online or by phone, leaves a lot to be desired. We simply returned it locally. But I was aware of stories that Breville refused to pay for DHL returns direct to the company. This isn't good for any company. It's clear they have a design flaw involving the LCD and/or shielding from heat in the oven. It's also clear, my sense from reading other people's stories, that the company is doing everything it can to either cover up these problems while they re-design, or simply ignore people.

Thru an error, I bought the regular oven, not the convection oven, and saw first hand the negative issues people had discussed about the knobs before I returned it.  Just then my niece visited and raved about her mother-in-law's Breville.  Hmmm, kind of pricey.  But Breville had a LOT of good reviews and the negative ones seemed to group into: 1) defective purchase or 2)inept user (getting burned).  Using a Bed Bath and Beyond Coupon I got it for $200+tax and hoped it wasn't defective :)  Never looked back.  I love to bake scones, brownies and cookies.  No matter what I did, I couldn't get my scones crisp on the outside, yet soft on the inside in my regular oven.  The convection oven does that to perfection.  Don't understand the complaints about the HOT oven for any of the models - the manufacturers all warn about it over and over.  Unless you place it in an open spot in your kitchen, it's not that hard to avoid getting burned - except thru inattention.  I bought the cutting board to put on the top... so sitting in the corner of my counter, only one side and the front door are hot spots.  I'm in an older apartmt, so I can't have anything but the oven plugged into the same outlet when I'm using it (1500 watts).  I am using a surge protector with a breaker - just to be safe.  I don't toast in it - which according to the manual is when you need the 1800 watts.  I love the easy to use dials.  I love that it turns off when done.  I love that you can easily add or reduce baking time and temperature while it's baking. I love that the center tray comes out when you open the door.  I've had pizza from a microwave for years and the first time I baked it in the convection, I was in heaven.  After two months use, my electric bill only went up 1 kwh p/day.  But I only bake treats & pizza.  I haven't used it for any serious meals.  I'm vegan, so I don't cook/bake/broil meat.

The display is easy to read and the bottom pulls out the front to make it easy to clean.  The instruction manual has recipes in it that you can try.

I needed a compact oven and looked at many. When I finally saw the Breville Compact Convection oven in person, I knew it was the right one for my needs.  The oven itself looks absolutely great!!!! It will complement any kitchen. When it is first purchased, it is necessary to do a 15 minute burn-in. This is very important. I took it out on our back porch so the fumes would not bother our birds. You could definitely smell the protective coating. Now, however, there are no fumes whatsoever. The oven is extremely quiet in convection mode and heats evenly. I am a terrible cook, but this little gem at least elevates me to a somewhat higher scale. I did some cookies, banana walnut bread, broiling of hot dogs and also some reheating. The cookies were perfect and evenly baked all around. Nothing burned. Same with the walnut bread. What a pleasure not having dry spots near the edges. It was terrific. The hot dogs were perfect. Crisp outside and nice and moist inside.  There are, of course, intelligent settings for various items such as baking, broiling, pizza, reheating, warming, etc. I have not tried all of the features, but I expect they will work just as well as the ones I tried. I did not use it to toast bread yet, but I would suspect it does a better job than a pop-up toaster.<br /><br />The dials are easy to use and you can customize to your heart's content. Even though there are pre-programmed settings, it is very simply to adjust, and the oven remembers your settings without defaulting to the original. If you want to get the original settings back, just unplug the unit and plug it back in. Everything will revert to factory settings.<br /><br />Because of the size of this oven, you can only do small amounts at a time. So I don't know if trying to do cookies for a large family is practical because you would have to make so many batches. Of course, you cannot do large roasts, turkey, etc. But that is what a large oven is for.<br /><br />This is a wonderful product that performs as advertised. It did not disappoint me so far, and I do not expect it to. I highly recommend it.rge oven is for.    This is a wonderful product that performs as advertised.

I purchased it to supplement the single oven I have since we have lots of entertaining during the holidays.  Since I started using it, I haven't used our full size oven, with the exception to baking a turkey or full sized roast.  The various temperature settings and baking/roasting options are perfect for just about anything including toast, pizza, stuffed mushrooms, baked stuffed shrimp, cheese fries, stuffed peppers, chicken wings, and much more.  Since we're a big grilling family, I haven't tried any red meats in there, but I have to imagine it would be the equavalent to a standard oven, just faster since there's less room to heat up.<br /><br />If you've dreamt of a double oven, but just don't have the room, you simply can't lose with this as a practical, economical solution.

Firstly it is a very impressive looking toaster oven. I had a small one before that didn't look AS small as it did once it was next to this one. I immediately cranked it up to burn off the leftover whatever from manufacturing. Once that was done, I promptly whipped up a batch of oatmeal cookies. I used my small Pampered Chef stoneware cookie sheet and it fit very well inside. I cooked the cookies in 3 batches of 6 for about 12-14 minutes each. On the second batch, I put the thermometer that I keep in my regular oven (that is perfectly accurate) into the Breville [[ASIN:B001L5TVGW Breville BOV800XL The Smart Oven 1800-Watt Convection Toaster Oven with Element IQ]], and found that the machine's temp is pretty far off. On the 3rd batch (oven had been on for over 30 minutes by this point including preheating time) with only 3 minutes left on the baking time, the oven reached about 327 degrees, it had been set to 350 degrees from the start. Although this is disappointing, it's not a deal breaker. Many of the regular ovens in our kitchens are of by many degrees (which is why I had the thermometer in there in the first place). The convection fan did make a bit more noise than I thought it should. More than just the whoosh of air sound, but more like a wobbly, wonky sound. Still, not horrible, and really only noticeable while I was standing right in front of it. Lastly, for the first two batches of cookies, I did not hear a beep, or a bell when the timer went off. I did, however hear it on the third batch. I would like it a little better if there was an interior light, I couldn't see my cookies baking and didn't want to keep opening the door due to the already lower than displayed temperature.<br /><br />All in all, I think this will be an often used appliance. I was thankful I didn't have to crank up my big oven, and I really like the convection feature. I bought one toaster oven cookbook when I bought this, and I'm about to buy another.  I'll keep you updated on the performance.<br /><br />Update: 7/19/2016 After 5 years of gentle use, my oven just quit working. I used it often, but not every day, so I would expect it to last more than 5 years.

I received my oven today via U.P.S., two days from the day I ordered it, and I'm in Alburgh, VT, right on the Canada border!

I have an oven thermometer, to check.  This oven is VERY accurate!  I must admit, I haven't cooked anything yet, since I wasn't sure when it would arrive.  But, everything seems to be working well, and the accuracy is great.  My house was originally built as a camp, (or weekend place to some of you from other parts of the country).

Cooking for one is so much better with a smaller oven, and this one does a great job with pretty much everything I've made in it: pizza, steaks, toast, fish, burritos ... the controls are easy to use, and there are a wide variety of settings, basically what you'd expect from a newer full-size oven.<br /><br />For a toaster oven, it's surprisingly big. You can bake a normal-size frozen pizza easily, and there's plenty of room on the 12x12 pans to cook for more than one if you've got company.<br /><br />It's also a little expensive, but it's definitely worth the money. I looked at cheaper toaster ovens, and none of the ones I found had anything like the feature set this one has. It's a little deeper than I would have liked, but I had no trouble making space for it once I found out what it could do.",2011-05-01

If you just want the short version, here it is: This is simply the best countertop oven you can buy. Period. With but one relatively minor exception, I honestly cannot think of one thing that could be improved with this wonderfully engineered and designed appliance. The oven cooks quickly, evenly and without fuss, exactly as you should expect for something in this price range. I live in an apartment that does not have a kitchen, so this is my stove, and I could not be happier. This Breville is gorgeous with a very attractive stainless steel exterior and real glass door with a generously sized handle. The door, in addition to featuring a large glass area to make it easy to monitor your cooking, also features a very clever magnet system that pulls the rack out for you when it is placed in the middle position. Very nice. The display is bright and easy to read and understand. The oven features several different pre-programmed cooking functions, such as bake (obviously right?), cookies, toast, bagel, reheat, warm, roast and broil. Each setting controls the temperature of the IQ Logic heating elements and the time of cooking. In addition, both temperature and cook time can be adjusted and memorized for future use. The oven also features a handy \\""frozen\\"" button which is ideal for re-heating TV dinners and frozen pizzas.<br /><br />Having had this oven for about six months now, I can confidently say that it is one of the best investments I've made. The one and only minor complaint I have with this oven is that the knobs for temperature, time and function are plastic coated to look like metal. Honestly, they feel incredibly cheap, almost like they are going to fall off in your hand. They haven't of course, and I'm sure they will work fine, but at $250, Breville really needs to source some solid feeling knobs with some heft to them. Then this would be a perfect product. As it stands, I can still heartily recommend this oven for anyone who wants the best countertop oven there is.anyone who wants the best countertop oven there is.",2011-04-30

Since I currently own a similar product KRUPS FCB5, I thought that it would be nice to trade up. However, I have buyers remorse. I love the idea of quartz lamps. It cooks much faster, and it provides superior results compared to regular electric stoves. However, I have very hard time trying to comprehend why there are so many people in love with this stove. There is a list of things I don't like about it:<br />1. While outside is covered in nice stainless steel, the every piece of metal behind the front door is cheap galvanized metal.<br />2, Nice round door handle is hollow inside and there are plastic brackets that attach it to the door.<br />3. Controls, buttons and switches are made out of cheap plastic.<br />4. Internal trays are paper thin and also made out of galvanized metal.<br />5. Even though this oven claims to be 0.8cubic foot, it appears it comes from depth rather than the preferable increase in hight.<br />6. Krups has 2 sets of 3 lamps on each side, while this product has only only 2 lamps on each side during the toast mode. During the broil, there is 3rd lamp on top that is also engaged in Breville.<br />7. After few uses, door glass gets dirty, and it is hard to clean since it is surrounded by metal frame. I much prefer frame-less door design.<br /><br />It is cheaply made product that is overpriced. I think that Krups FCB product line offers better value and better construction.",2011-04-25

My older model did break, but I received a new one.","I had a problem with mine.  The LCD would go out intermittently and the oven would not stop on its own afterward.  I returned it early March, after which I received a backorder notice.  Come near April 15th, I recieved a second backorder notice.  They told me it was double delayed to June 1st.  I was really upset and disappointed, but when I contacted them two days later they said it was an error and it had already had been shipped out.  I received mine on time, last week or so.<br /><br />My guess is that they were on backorder due to manufacturing delays, probably due to some electronic components delayed from the Tsunami in Japan. I was upset about it at first, but there's not much you can do about that. I think the one I finally got back is an improved version, so I'm actually glad.  The stocks that I saw in stores were probably previously contracted orders before the Tsunami.  Again, that's only my educated guess.<br /><br />The new one I did get has an improved LCD.  It's white and turns orange instead of the older blue one.<br /><br />After all that said, I use mine for everything.  I haven't fired up my large oven in about a year.  It's much quicker to preheat and to cook.  And when it does cook, it seems to do a better job.  The time and convenience are worth it if you can afford it.  It is kind of expensive.

Worked well although cosmetically the unit started looking tired quickly. Spent the extra money this time and decided to try the Breville. Been about a month and have been very happy with it. Easy to use and seems to heat the food thoroughly. Hardest part to get used to is setting the timer - the Cuisinart didn't have that and we always had to remember or guess how long food had been cooking. Like the timer, just need to remember to set it for what we are cooking. Bought it primarily to toast, reheat leftovers and heat frozen foods. Did like the fact that on the Cuisinart there was a defrost button and this one I didn't see that which means you have to it to bake mode and then dial the temp down to  150. Wish I realized ahead of time the top of the overn also acts as a warming tray - would have considered purchasing the wooden board they make that sits on top.

We were so excited as we have recently given up our microwave and found so many uses for our new toaster oven.  We used it to reheat leftovers (more efficient than heating up the large stove) as well as cook smaller items.  Our convection fan was a little loud and rattly, which I now realize was a defect, but the oven still worked just fine.  Both my husband and I were very happy with our new appliance.  I baked loaves, pizza, bread, fries, etc.  Everything turned out perfect when we learned a few of the nuances of adjusting for convection - I liked that you can easily see how things are going inside without having to open or turn on a light (like in a normal oven).  It also made great toast, bagels, etc. and I was beginning to consider giving away our toaster when the Breville just stopped working.<br /><br />I was frustrated, but not particularly surprised as I had read lots of the negative reviews on here, and it just seems there are some lemons in the bunch.  We had even held onto the packaging just in case the noisy fan turned into a problem.  Well, unfortunately we were passed Amazon's return period, so we had to return the oven to Breville under warranty.  This was not difficult they were helpful in directing us in how to do so (at no cost).<br /><br />That is where the good experience has ended.  We started the return process in the beginning of March and our oven arrived to Breville around the 11th.  Only once we had sent it there were we notified that they were out of stock and would not be able to ship a new one until early April.  I looked on Amazon and saw that they had ovens in stock, so that was irritating.  Then we received a phone call from Breville telling us that our oven would ship April 19th.  Again, frustrated, but what could I do?  Today (April 8) I have been informed that our oven will ship on June 1st.  This would not be so frustrating were it not for the fact that Amazon is currently selling them (at the same price as Brevilleusa).  So either Amazon had a ridiculous amount of stock or the stock just sits there waiting, or Breville is supplying other suppliers before taking care of customers who have already purchased an oven!

I wanted an oven that could really take the place of my big oven for a lot of jobs and I think I've found it. Heats up quickly, easy to use. I like the large size of the inside and having knobs instead of touch pads. Crumb tray is in front; easy to pull out. Made a perfect loaf of quick bread, evenly browned. It did cook 10 minutes faster than regular oven...need to shorten your bake times I think. I baked a pie crust for a one crust pie very quickly and it was nicely browned, and toasted coconut for the pie topping, which it did nicely also (I did have to stir it half way through). One thing I would change: the oven starts counting down the bake time right away after preheating. I wish it would wait, after the beep telling me preheating is done, to let me come tell it to start the bake time. But I can live with this since it seem to be such a great oven! It looks nice and doesn't seem to get mega hot on the outside either. I also like that the baking pan and broiling rack are enameled, not just aluminum.

Then mentioned all of the positive features plus the price of the unit so I was not shocked when I went looking for the best price.<br /><br />There are some excellent reviews here so I will touch on a few things that I have noticed over the short time I have had the unit.<br /><br />I would suggest you purchase the cutting board and if you like to bake bread and make pizzas then the pizza stone is a well worth addition.<br /><br />We have used the oven for baking artisan breads, pizzas, broiling open faced sandwiches, and of course toast.  All with outstanding results.<br /><br />Some features to note:<br /><br />1. When opening the door when you have it in the middle rack, do it slowly, otherwise you could wind up with whatever you are making slide out.  I did this with the pizza the first time, thinking it would simply stay put but it slid out too quickly.  They tell you to open the door slowly in the directions!<br /><br />2. The oven does get hot when in use, but it is mostly on the top.  This is great for heating plates or leaving your cutting board on top to prevent you from touching the top.  There is very little heat around the sides, front, or back to cause any concern. We have a few plastic cutting boards standing against the wall near the oven, 5 inches away and it is not a concern.<br /><br />3. The pizza stone heats up very quickly, they mention 15 minutes which is very fast compared to the Emile Henry Pizza Stone that we use in the main oven.  It requires 45 minutes of pre heating.  Hint to the Emile Henry company, please make a 13\\"" stone with the special glazing for the Breville Oven.<br /><br />4. When making bread or pizza using the stone we found it much simpler to use parchment paper than corn meal.  Placing a loaf of artisan bread (we have tried three of the recipes in the Healthy Bread in 5 minutes a Day) on top of the pizza stone is not a problem, however pizza can be a different matter.  We solved this problem by purchasing a 10 inch round cake lifter.  Place the parchment paper on the metal lifter,then slide it onto the preheated stone.  Nothing falls away and it can be done quickly and no mess.<br /><br />5. When your pizza or bread is 3/4 finished, open the oven and remove the parchment paper, this way you get the nice brown crisp finish on your pizza or bread.<br /><br />6.  When making open faced sandwiches I would suggest setting the broil setting to 400 degree's instead of 500.  The first time I broiled brochette with salsa and cheese on top of the bread, it made a mess on the broiler plate.  After than I used parchment paper at the 500 degree setting and the paper went very brown.  Sandwich was great but I was concerned, after than, 400 degree setting.  It takes slightly longer but parchment paper does not brown.<br /><br />7.  There is a large crumb tray that opens up at the bottom.  I find this an excellent design.  You can simply remove it, and clean it up after each time you use your oven.  Makes it easy to keep your oven spotless.<br /><br />8. When baking bread I find the oven heats up quicker, and since it is a smaller unit bakes the bread slightly quicker than a regular oven.  It is very easy to test doneness by inserting a thermapen in the bottom of the bread (artisan) and see if your temperature is between 205 - 210.<br /><br />9. The controls to set the oven are very easy and they go over each one very well in the manual.  I would have liked to see the broil setting adjust in 50 degree amounts instead of the 100 (wanted to broil at 450) but that is a small feature I would have liked to see.<br /><br />10.  As mentioned by many reviewers, toasting is outstanding whether you have one slice or 6, but it does take longer than you might except.<br /><br />11. You can place a full size bread pan in the oven as well as change the position of the rack if you want to place the pizza under the broiler for a short time.Breville designed the oven so you can place the 13 inch plate or pizza stone in all three slots.<br /><br />12.

However, I've been using toaster ovens since the late 60's and the Breville BOV800XL is so much more capable than past ovens I've owned, it's caused me to completely rethink what they are for.<br /><br />In the past, toaster ovens were functional as toasters, but shy away from that and you were pushing the envelope. The results were spotty at best and occasionally resulted in a burnt mess.<br /><br />The Breville oven completely changes that.  Don't think of it as a toaster oven, think of it as a smaller version of your current oven. I've thrown about everything I can think of at the Breville oven and the results have been equal to or in some cases better than my current oven. I roasted a chicken in it; it came out perfect (albeit finding a chicken that will safely fit in it was a bit of a challenge). Baked bread - perfect, Apple cobbler - also perfect, broiling is a snap, Bagels, etc... Everything exceeded my past experiences and expectations<br />My only complaint is that the manual does not mention that the pizza tray that comes with it fits most store-bought frozen pizza.  Once I figured that out, OHMG!<br /><br />Yes it is a bit pricey, for me when I consider what the oven has done to simplify and in some cases improve things in our kitchen, it's worth every penny.",2011-04-01

We've had it for about 3.5 months and we use it all the time ... way more than we use our double ovens.  It's a good sized oven so you need to have some space on a countertop to fit it, but looking at its dimensions online before purchasing it I was honestly way more worried about this than I needed to be.  It doesn't look as big on our countertop as the dimensions say.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Heats up quickly (faster than our double ovens)<br />- Uses less electricity than a full size oven<br />- Large for a toaster oven so you can fit a lot<br />- Toasts great bread, bagels, garlic bread, etc.<br />- Cooks pizza, brownies, cookies, etc. quite evenly<br />- Convection feature is nice<br />- Tons of features and settings<br />- This is really more like a countertop oven than a toaster oven<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Takes up some space on your countertop (but not as big or bulky as I thought it was going to be)<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this toaster oven if you have the space for it.

It is very nice. Initially, I was looking at cheaper alternatives. I made the right move by getting this one. I find myself looking for opportunities to use it when I would have otherwise used a microwave.<br /><br />I was originally getting it so that I could get away from using my propane stove (which I didn't use much anyway) since propane is not easy to get but electricity is.<br /><br />There are a couple things I would like improved. Some toaster ovens are not as hot on their exterior. This one does get hot. I have ordered the serving board that goes on top hoping to get the use of that space back. You're restricted on what you can place on the top because of the heat. I've also ordered some other accessrories for it. And I would have liked a good light on the inside. As it is, I use a flashlight to check on the food, even though the nice glass window does let you look in. I just can't see the doneness of some food without a light. Maybe later, I won't feel the need to keep such a close eye on the food. There might be a couple other quibbles about it. But the bottom line is that I really like it. I am beginning to trust its settings and not the cooking guidance (time & temp) that some food instructions provide. I've ordered a toaster oven cookbook hoping to get some more guidance. I'm not a great cook. But this thing actually lets me put something in and then take out a nicely cooked piece of food. That's exciting to me. I tried a whole chicken and it came out almost perfect. And I've been playing around cooking other things. I don't feel I have to restrict myself to getting just microwave foods anymore. Getting a toaster oven, and this one in particular, was a good choice.<br /><br />I recommend it.<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Follow up...  I have had this oven for well over four years now. Other than my suggestions listed in my original review (above), this has remained a superb product.

Purchasing the Breville is a decision I'm glad I made after doing my research on all the so-called toaster ovens on the market.<br /><br />After my husband did the new oven prep work, I started in on it with biscuits, blueberry muffins, chicken breasts, etc., my husband broiled a hot dog, thawed out a slice of bread . . .  anyway, we did give it a workout on its maiden voyage and WOW!  It performed above any expectations I had and managed to look \\""mahvelous\\"" the whole time.  It's really a stunning addition to the kitchen and so easy to use. Very roomy, pre-heats quickly, digital readouts are large, it lets you know when pre-heat is ready with a discreet \\""beep beep\\"" and is very quiet, even with the convection button on; oven rack slides in and out effortlessly (automatically if its in the middle rack position)with a very solidly built feel to it.  The round pizza pan and broiler pans included with the oven are high quality pieces and seriously non-stick.  Biscuits didn't stick (I used the pizza pan)and the chicken breasts slid right off the broiler pan - no non-stick spray used.  They were a snap to clean up, too; just soapy water.<br /><br />The few dollars extra spent on this Smart Oven has proven to be inconsequential given the obvious quality and workmanship of this high-end appliance.  More than a step above a toaster oven, it's added a reliable bake/broil/toast/roast alternative to my big oven.<br /><br />Sunday afternoon I got back online and ordered the bamboo serving tray for the top of the oven to finish off the \\""look,\\"" and to be able to put things on top of the unit which gets hot; hot enough to warm up the leftover muffins the next day while the pot roast was warming up for dinner!

I have had this Breville BOV800XL Oven for a year.  I cook in it everyday.  About four months ago, the LCD panel blew out!  Now it is very very dim and I cannot see what I am doing.<br /><br />The Material!!!  When I wash the grate, the inside of the oveh, or the outside edge around the oven opening, the metal WIPES COMPLETELY OFF WITH THE RAG!!!!!  Now - the food is still on the surfaces and will remain there for eternity.  The food does not come off, but the metal does.  And now the grate is a coppery, yellow color that soaks in every little spill never to be washed or scrubbed off again!!!  And the roasting pan!!!! It is the same way.  It warps, and the metal wipes completely off with just soap and water. Never mind soft scrub. Just soap and water, and off the metal goes!  Besides, it stinks horrible metalic when you cook in it and then your food tastes metallic - very strongly.  Toxic waste, here it comes!!  I am sure 10 years ago this was a superior oven with fine metal material, but since (like every other corporation) they have sold out to the Chinease, it is cheaper than a $2.00 toy oven!!!  I am livid.  My husband and I do OUR BEST to buy American made, or close.  If we absolutely cannot, than we do our best to do without!!!<br /><br />I would NOT spend the money.

Meats and especially chicken and fish products are delivered juicy, moist, tender and browned perfectly. Cookies are texture perfect. Pizza homemade and store bought- heated and cooked to perfection.

(2)Selection knob for specific food, and (3)temperature knob. The stove automatic adjusts the time, and temperature for a variety of food that you can change at any time to suit individual tastes.<br /><br />I have had no problems with the electricity useage of this stove.

My heart goes out to you.,"My Breville arrived in a timely fashion after ordering from Amazon.com. Plugging it in and going through the start-up instructions, the unit fan began to screech loudly. This only happened when the unit had heated up for about 2 minutes. I called the Breville service number, which is JUST a service (i.e. not Breville's business location in California) and was given instructions on how to send the unit back, advised that the whole process would take around two weeks. Grrrr. Ground transportation from Pennsylvania to California.<br /><br />After two weeks, I tried to call the 'service' again, with the operator's name and extension number in hand. She was never 'in', and messages left to call back had NO RESULT. Breville did have a helpful customer service person who checked to see that the returned Breville had in fact arrived. It had, but their internal tracking had 'lost' it and a replacement had not been sent out as promised. The help operator promised to send out a unit 'first thing the next day'.<br /><br />However ... I got an e-mail later in the evening advising me that there were NO UNITS AVAILABLE (a 'stocking difficulty') and that there would not be a new replacement unit to ship until May 22, almost two weeks AFTER the promised ship-out date. Breville did not offer to ship the unit by air to speed things up or do more than apologize. Of course none of this can be corrected by anyone working at the customer service level, who can only say 'sorry' and leave it at that.<br /><br />But, considering the priceyness of this unit, and the hype of its features, it seems that ... if it works well, GREAT.

It's super easy to use and think how much you will save $$$ in electric! GET IT! **UPDATE** I just cooked a 4.6lb. chicken in this on Sunday and we couldn't believe how awesome it came out.  Don't be afraid to cook a whole chicken in this, I was at first.  All I did was break the back bone a bit so it can sit lower in the roasting pan that came with the Breville and it worked great!

I did extensive research and decided on the Breville. I do a lot of cooking for one or two people and it was a waste to heat up a full size oven. The Breville solved the problem.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/3/13 The bottom heating elements quit working in the oven- so disappointed! The oven quit working at the 2 year point. I contacted Breville and they had no sympathy, but to imply I must have done something- I didn't. Anyway, there are no service places in the state I live in, the two I found are in different states and when i contacted one of them for an estimate they said they would have to call me back. They were not sure if the parts were available. I suspect between the repair costs and the shipping hastle and cost I am better off buying a new oven.  Certainly won't be a Breville!<br /><br />UPDATE 3/13/13 I have to retract my earlier update. After trying to find someone in my area to repair my oven which there were none, I emailed Breville and they changed their earlier attitude (different customer service person). I returned the oven that quit working (they send me a prepaid Fed Ex label), I paid to have it packaged, and returned it to them. Today I received a Refurbished Breville oven to replace the one that quit working at no cost to me. It only has a 90 day warranty, so i am keeping my fingers crossed.

I have other Breville products and am very happy with them.  So when I saw this toaster oven I was interested.  And with the convection aspect of it, we were very interested.  We had a convection oven in the past and loved it.  And of course, when we saw this oven on the Breville site, we immediately checked Amazon, and found a much better price.  But then I started reading the reviews.<br /><br />Doesn't get to temperature.  Doesn't maintain temperature.  Doesn't cook easily or evenly.  Had to send the 2nd or 3rd one back since it was defective. These reviews gave me a little pause.  But we purchased the oven anyway.  Either, all of the bad reviews were from people who received a defective model (ALL??) or were from individuals who didn't read the directions correctly.  We love this product.  We use it almost daily from toasting bread, bagels, and the like, to baking, to broiling, to EVERYTHING it says it can do.  The oven (our 1st one.  We have never had to return the unit) gets to the proper temperature correctly and quickly.  It maintains the temperature throughout the cooking time.  I tested this with an in oven thermometer and it is accurate.  It bakes well and the convection setting does it quickly and evenly.

I did not buy this oven from Amazon, and they did not beg me to review it.  But I will anyway. This is not long on technical details--I'll leave that to others.  It is instead just a succinct, honest overall assessment of a product in a category that, frankly, seems to be filled with stinkers.<br /><br />I have had this oven for a month or so and really love it. It is well designed and well built. Yes, it is expensive for a toaster oven--even a convection model. But is it worth it? Unequivocally, yes.  Its design and construction are exceptional overall. (I do think the control knobs could stand to feel a bit more solid, but this is nothing that affects the functionality of the oven.) The quality of the cooking is outstanding--baking/toasting is completely uniform and even. It beats the performance of our full-size oven hands-down. It saves time and electricity. It allowed us to finally throw out our 4-slice toaster which hogged counter space while delivering limited benefit. It comes with very well-made and perfectly-matched accessories (the pizza and baking/broiler pans). It has clever features (such as magnets built into the door which pull the rack out enough to retrieve hot food without a hot pad). But best of all, to me it actually IS what it is advertised to be. That's really all you can ask of a product. It has exceeded expectations in just about every way. The only thing I can't gauge yet is of course how long it will last--but so far, this is the best toaster oven I have ever seen or used.<br /><br />With enthusiasm I recommend it!",2011-03-06

It was white, hard, and hot. Our old T-Fal toasted far better. Then we tried cookies. Perfect. And a souffle. Very good, but a little too dark at top. I realized what I really wanted this puppy to do was cook my from-scratch pizza like a pizza oven would. The Breville has a pizza setting and devotes several pages of its instruction booklet to making a perfect pizza. Oh, baby. Using the pizza stone, following the directions, we got toast redux: white, hard, and hot. And flat like pita bread. OK. Break the rules. Put the stone on the bottom rack, make dough/topping/grate mozzerella and try again. Do the pre-heat, insert new pizza, run for default time. White. Hard. Hot. Leave in until edges brown and cheese almost black. Still crust is white, hard, hot with faint brown at edges,and totally soft, white underneath. And this with the stone and on the bottom rack! SO I turned off the Breville and I cranked up my oven, put another just-created pizza on my old stone where the crust browned and puffed beautifully, the cheese melted beautifully, the crust bottom was brown and crispy.<br />This morning I box and return the Breville.",2011-02-28

I bought it a year ago from Bed Bath & Beyond, and used a 20% discount coupon. The other thing that I appreciate about buying products from BB&B is that should this unit ever start acting funky, I can return it at any time.  Yes, seriously.  BB&B takes things back for years after you've bought the item from them.<br /><br />Anyway, this isn't a review of BB&B, so on with the oven comments.  I read some reviews that said the oven temperature is off.  I haven't personally tested this, because my items always come out cooked as they should be; in fact, I actually reduce the temperature and cooking time, because the convection fan circulates air around the item maintaining an even temperature for the whole cooking time (vs.  a gas oven that heats up, then turns off its heat when it reaches temp, and then turns it on again when the temp goes lower then what it was set for).<br /><br />I've also read reviews that only comment on this item as a toaster oven, and then complain that it's really expensive for being \\""just a toaster oven\\"".  However, this baby is way more then a toaster oven.  It is a full blown functioning oven that can bake, broil, and do everything your regular oven can do in a shorter amount of preheat, and cook time, w/o using nearly as much energy as a regular oven.  In addition, Cook's Illustrated recently did a product review of toaster ovens and found this model to be the best out of the 10 or so they tested.  Specifically, the oven uses quartz heating rods which allows it to have an even temperature, i.e., no hot spots, and cooks items evenly as well, e.g., no need to rotate a pan in the middle of baking.  I find this product to be well worth its price tag.<br /><br />Again, I love this oven!  I use it all the time and rarely use my regular gas oven.  In fact, the only time that I do use my gas oven is when I'm making pizza (I make fresh dough and then use a pizza stone that needs to be preheated for a good 30-45 minutes, the Breville is really not that great of a fresh pizza baking oven, although it might do well with a frozen one); or when I'm baking something that requires me to have a large pan, or two or more pans in the oven at once.ally not that great of a fresh pizza baking oven, although it might do well with a frozen one); or when I'm baking something that requires me to have a large pan, or two or more pans in the oven at once.",2011-02-25

The internet is full of BS here's the real scoop folks:<br /><br />I accurately checked temperature with multiple other oven thermometers in front and back, mid and bottom rack, results were similar in all scenarios:<br /><br />Set to low temps 150-300, it accurately heats to the correct temperature! It has an even temperature throughout and it is excellent at maintaining the temperature (not matter where I put the thermometers the results came back very similar). It does heat up fast (at low temps).<br /><br />BUT - Set to broil at 500F, it took 20 minutes to reach 445F. After another 10 minutes it topped out at 450F. So if you think this will reach high temperatures like a normal oven, it won't, which was disappointing because many reviews on here suggest and imply that it does, but these folks have never checked the temperature, because it does not.<br /><br />Not all heating elements turn on, different ones are used by different modes, and no mode uses them all (the manual explains how this works). So though it clearly has heating elements that COULD do this if they were all on - there is no way, even by switching modes to try and trick it, to reach a higher temperature than about 450F with this oven (depending slightly on your kitchen room temperature). Pizza mode is supposed to reach 450F, but it also takes over 20 minutes to heat to this temperature, even though it uses the 2 bottom elements, which seem to be more powerful per element than the upper 3.<br /><br />In other news... the manual is inaccurate in how it describes the preheat features, the nonstick baking pans say on them that it is not recommended to put them in the dishwasher.<br /><br />Much like other reviewers, I was pretty impressed with the rest. Build quality looks awesome, and all the rest of the stuff other folks on here said is accurate so I don't need to go into it again.

We really didn't have any complaints about the old B&D;  but we had purchased a Breville toaster on impulse a year or so earlier, and not only is it hands down the greatest home appliance I have ever bought, it also makes our old b&D unit look frumpy sitting there next to it.  So I figured this was a good gamble.<br /><br />First of all, this is not the greatest home appliance I have ever bought; that distinction remains firmly with the Breville toaster.  Second, I think people need to be aware that the sides and top of this toaster oven get very, very, Very VERY hot.  So buy the cutting board! (Frankly, given the price point and the fact that you can literally burn your flesh on the top of this thing, the cutting board should be in the box as standard equipment.)  And put it next to stuff that doesn't mind heat, such a toaster.<br /><br />Finally, it works very well.  Better than the old B&D, which was an okay piece.

There are 3 levels to cook on, the grate slides out automatically if in the middle position, and you can dial in your exact temperatures. Good quality pans come with it as well. I'm still working on what darkness levels to dial in for toast. Since I don't want to burn it I seem to set it too light and end up making it lighter than I actually want it.  It is expensive but it is well worth the money for something I use every day.",2011-02-06

I'm a pretty good cook, but this oven has made me an even  better one without doing anything different. They say this oven has a \\""brain\\"", and they're not kidding. Whether you are baking, roasting, broiling or toasting bread, the oven knows what to do to make your food great. Gluten free bread bakes like a loaf from the bakery. Cakes, brownies, cornbread (all gluten free) come out moist and luscious. Meatloaf, chicken, and pork chops all roast, bake or broil to perfection. Toast comes out perfectly, especially bagels. Just set the control and timer then let the oven do the rest. I've had at least three \\""convection\\"" toaster ovens over the past two years, and all three stopped \\""convecting\\"" after a couple of months, the last one almost catching on fire! This oven is extremely well built and makes your kitchen look better by just sitting there.  The rack is very sturdy, and the broiling, pizza and roasting pans are top quality and easy to clean. Wish that the pizza stone was included, though. I call this a counter top oven, not a toaster oven, because it truly works like the big oven without having to heat up the whole kitchen (and take out all of the pans, etc. stored inside), especially a really small kitchen like mine. The crumb tray is the whole bottom of the oven, and it removes easily for clean up (it's got a coating the keeps things from sticking, too). The digital display/controls are quite intuitive. I know that the price is pretty steep, but get this one if you can, you won't regret it.",2011-02-03

We do not care about the low-end toaster/bagels functions because we rarely eat them and have a toaster for that anyway.  We wanted to replace using the main built-in (non-convection) oven because it takes too much power, especially in the hot FL weather where the A/C is on and has to counteract the big oven.<br /><br />Overall, we like the Breville -- it has done everything we used it for very well (mostly just roasting and broiling).  We insisted on the convection option and like the flexible way it applies various levels of power to the heating elements -- all these should save energy (the main reason we wanted the unit in the first place) along with properly cooking the food of course.<br /><br />Two suggestions, both about the oven rack:<br /><br />1.  Provide a stop (like regular built-in ovens have) to prevent the rack from coming all the way out of the oven so easily, and<br /><br />2.  Provide a way for the oven rack to automatically come part-way out when the door is opened while the rack is in the top position (the same way it does when in the lower position).<br /><br />One tip:  We always use an oven mitt when touching any part of the hot oven or metal racks and containers to avoid burns.",2011-02-02

It did take me a while to remember to select the size of the pizza, etc. (I'm not big on reading manuals--my bad)  As an added bonus, it looks great sitting on my kitchen counter.  Oh, and the plug is kind of cool too--it has a big ring that's easy to take hold of to pull out of the socket (not a big deal, just another cool feature).  This oven is well-designed and I expect it will be the last toaster oven I purchase.  Also, some have mentioned that they cannot use the oven when using other appliances because of the high wattage.

Was using a very old DeLonghi toaster oven with no convection. Today I used the Breville to cook frozen pork strips. They cooked pretty good especially with the convection and the frozen food option. Had one thick piece a little red and had to cook it longer. Strips cooked faster than my old Delonghi would have for sure. I like the clever auto eject using a magnet in the middle rack position. The grill tray had a small chip of the paint in a corner, I am now working with Breville to get it replaced. Sure seems like for this price the grill and drip pans should be stainless steel rather than coated plain steel. My Delonghi had the same coated steel drip pan and it rusted over time. Another reason for stainless is that Breville has a warning with the unit saying not to use the dishwasher to washer these pans :-(. Sure wish I knew this before I bought this. Last gripe, the LCD display is not designed quite right. When the oven is on the counter and you are standing in front of it, the display is not that clear.

The display is easy to read, it beeps when it's preheated and when your food is finished cooking.  There is a selection knob for toast, including number of slices, and how dark you want it.  There is a selection for pizza, fresh or frozen, and how big it is.  There are settings for cookies, bagels, roast, broil and reheating.  It's so smart (and fast) -- just tell it what you are cooking.  When the rack is placed in the center slot, magnets make it pop out when you open the door, making it easier to remove hot items.

This is my first toaster oven so I have no prior experience with them.  However I researched toaster ovens for quite awhile before making my first attempt.  Noting that I couldn't find any brands without horror stories somewhere, I decided to try the Breville.  I live in Texas, so having something small that won't heat up the kitchen is a must during the summer.  I love baking/roasting though so I needed an alternative.  I also wanted a convection toaster oven due to the lower operating cost.<br /><br />The oven does get hot and requires 4 inches of open space round the top and sides when in use.  I have found that the handle itself does not get hot, just be careful to not touch the door itself or get in the habit of using a mit.  The convection feature is great.  Lower temperatures AND cooking times seems to be the benefit.  The toaster oven pre-heats much faster than my oven.  The oven seems to cool down fairly quickly once I am done with it.  I do unplug it when not in use.<br /><br />So far I have made a veggie pizza, baked chicken breasts and tenders, a 6\\"" quiche, oven roasted potatoes, and oven roasted edamame.  I don't have the temp/time changes down yet so I stay close to the kitchen and check the items frequently.  I have not tried toasting, but that wasn't a priority for me.  I still have a toaster that I am happy with.  The controls have been easy to remember after the first use.  I didn't notice any strong odors during its first run either.  Maybe some units have more to burn off than others?<br /><br />The pizza pan is non-stick (not bird-safe).  The interior of the oven also has a non-stick coating.  I take the precaution of putting my parrot in the bedroom with the door closed while it is operating.  The roasting pan and broiler rack are enamel coated.<br /><br />Out of curiosity I emailed Breville about whether it would be possible to buy an additional rack to do multiple items at once.  The manual mentions nothing about this possibility.  Breville replied that it would be fine, but would require a tweak on the cooking times (to be expected).<br /><br />So far I am very happy with this toaster oven.ack to do multiple items at once.

The first unit wasn't purchased from Amazon and was a factory refurbished unit which I purchased for $139 including an extended warranty.  13 months later this refurbed unit developed an intermittent ON/OFF switch which made it a hassle to get it going.  Ordinarily I wouldn't consider purchasing another unit when the original one had failed.  BUT, this Smart Oven, by it's versatility and excellent performance, made itself indispensable in our kitchen.  SO, I bought the 3 year Square Trade extended warranty from Amazon, as well as the new Smart Oven for around $282.  If the unit fails within 3 years, it has that extended warranty coverage.  $10 per year is a small price to pay for this extended warranty peace of mind (just in case it has the same ON/OFF-switch-DNA as our first unit).

The toaster oven never made great toast, heated pizza slices OK, and really never seemed to do much else of worth to me.  With my small kitchen, I didn't have room to add a second oven, so I struggled cooking for multiple guests on the holidays, but I did what I could.  When we knew we were moving, we explored the possibility of adding a second oven to the new kitchen, but we started with this as a possible substitute for a full-size oven.  At first I scoffed, but I have to say that I'm quite impressed with this little oven.  It works far better than I could have predicted - I'd say that \\""toaster oven\\"" really is selling the device short.  I've baked double-deep-dish apple pies in it, as well as the usual small oven duties, and have had excellent results.  Things do brown a little more quickly because of the proximity of the heating elements, and even with convection it isn't perfectly even, but as a second oven in a small kitchen it was just what I needed when the full-size wasn't an option.

I'm just amazed.  The preset functions take away the guess-work.  It toasts bread better than any toaster oven I've owned and toasts bagels to perfection (soft and chewy on the inside, a light toast on the outside).  It also bakes pizza, fish, and chicken as well as (if not better than) our large built-in convection oven while taking significantly less time to heat up and saving us energy costs.  We use it at least 2 to 3 times a day.<br /><br />Although extra care must be taken (read the instruction manual), I found this oven is much easier to maintain than other toaster ovens.  The crumb tray is easy to clean with a damp cloth, and that includes the baked on chocolate chips from my husband's favorite bagels. That said, I would advise against baking anything in this oven that splatters as it would be nearly impossible to clean the interior of the oven.  Save those dishes for a self-cleaning oven.<br /><br />The downside of this oven is the bakeware restrictions. Breville recommends using just their bakeware.  The oven comes with a pizza pan, a baking pan, and a broiler.  Other Breville products can be ordered on-line. Use of  generic types of bakeware is mentioned, but it comes with lots of disclaimers about possible damage to the unit, injury, etc.  The pizza pan is easy to clean but the baking pan has a poor quality enamel coating which is nearly impossible to get clean.  I have yet to use the broiler but it appears to have the same coating as the baking pan.<br /><br />One reviewer said they didn't buy this product because it doesn't allow the use of aluminum foil.  That is not correct.  While the user manual does offer some cautionary words regarding the use of foil (it cannot come in contact with the heating elements and too much foil may cause the unit to overheat), foil can be used in the oven.  For example, in accordance with the user manual, I routinely use foil to keep food from sticking to the baking pan.ossible to get clean.

The top of the oven can get warm, but it can also be used to warm plates.  Toast cooks evenly, and I have not had any problems with blown fuses, even though I only have 15 amp outlets in my kitchen.

Every thing I said in the original review that follows still applies but 1 major problem developed. The lower quartz elements just stopped working for any and all functions. The good news was I still had 2 mos. remaining on the warranty. Breville customer service was fairly easy to reach by phone and to work with. I emailed proof of purchase and received a return Fedex label via email same day. I received a new oven about 10 days after packing and shipping the \\""old\\"" one. So props to Breville customer service but a big downgrade from my original 5 star rating for the oven. An expensive appliance should last more than 10 mos. Also not happy that my warranty on the new oven only has a warranty of the 2 mos. remaining on the 1 I returned.<br /><br />Original review:<br />Bought this a few mos ago to replace an even more expensive Krups convection toaster oven. The Krups' controls failed after just a few years but it did introduce me to quartz heating elements and they, along with all the 5 star reviews, are why I chose the Breville.<br />The Breville is an upgrade from the Krups, with a larger capacity although about the same exterior size, toasts faster and more evenly and with more intuitive and versatile controls. I have a 36\\"" dual fuel range with a cavernous oven so I use the Breville often to save the energy it takes to bake and roast in the big one. I have experienced lots of the positives noted in many of the 5 star reviews so I won't rehash them.<br />A few of the negatives in the bad reviews I really can't agree with. On the lack of an interior light; unless you're cooking in a dark cave, why can't you see inside a small oven like this? On the magnetic pullout (cool feature) only provided for the middle rack location; on the bottom it would pull the rack out only an inch or 2, on the top it would pull it out possibly too far. This feature is for toast which you can remove barehanded without getting burned. The other 2 locations are for baking, roasting and broiling, pot holders required anyway. One negative mentioned was a prohibition of foil and glass. I didn't see this in the manual and I routinely use pyrex, corning ware and aluminum foil with no problem.<br />I do have one caution; don't put anything really heavy like the huge casserole I baked in this. It can bend the rack and cause it to drop out of the grooves, then it wedges against the walls. I had to remove the casserole and reach under the rack and pop it back into the grooves.

I had told him not to buy it because I had the Cuisinart convection oven.  He didn't listen and purchased it anyway because I had made some complaints about how hard it was to clean mine. I put in my new oven and have used it everyday since Christmas.  I use mostly to lightly toast rolls but never the less it does an excellent job.  I did roast some BBQ ribs and they turned out pretty good.  I don't know what you can do when a recipe calls out to cover with foil but I haven't read my manual yet and I'm sure it will tell me how to get around this dilemma.  What I love the most is that this unit is very easy to keep clean.

In comparison to the old B&D, the Oster seemed rather large and the top would get very hot. The old one had white plastic on top and sides and would only get warm. Also the controls on the Oster were not marked well. Seemed very disposable. .<br /><br />After reading all the five star reviews here I ordered this Breville from Amazon. Had high hopes, but I noticed that it too gets very hot on top and the left side as well. Only the right side seems to be insulated. The magnetic opening mechanism is annoying by making a grating sound. The plug protrudes from the wall and can come into contact with the back which gets super hot. So if your plug is right behind make sure it doesn't melt the power cord.  Only the LCD control system is of any value, but it's not worth the premium cost over a cheap one. Even the control knobs seem very cheap.<br /><br />Overall the Made in China Breville operates just like any other cheap toaster oven, not much different than the Oster.

That's the only negative impression I've gotten, and really, it doesn't actually impact the use of the machine. It's not like it needs to deflect bullets or anything.<br /><br />First good thing I noticed was how the back of the compartment has a bowed \\""outdent\\"" to accommodate a pizza that wouldn't otherwise fit. Nice smart design detail, and the unit comes with a round pan to fit.<br /><br />I love how the handle is substantial in size and designed to put the door in a perfectly horizontal resting position when open. Ergonomically, it's nice to be able to just grab a big handle instead of pinch a little piece of black plastic that's right next to a hot glass door, like our last toaster oven.<br /><br />But what made me smile out loud, so to speak, is the display and controls. Turning the knob under the left edge of the display rolls an indicator on the left side up and down the 9 modes (Toast, Bagel, Bake, etc.). The top large knob controls the top large display items (Temp), and the bottom large knob controls the bottom large display item (Time/# of Slices). The Convection and Frozen indicators have clear intuitive icons that match the buttons.<br /><br />I'm usually skeptical of appliances that offer a lot of detailed modes (like all the blenders with 15 settings, which pretty much only ever get used on high or pulse, at least by me). But when my wife commented that she was having to turn it up rather dark to do our two pieces of toast properly, I noted that we are toasting wide loaf bread, and that two pieces pretty much amount to the same surface area as three pieces of \\""standard\\"" sized bread. We adjusted the toast darkness back to the mid range and set the toaster for three slices, and they came out perfectly. I actually have no idea how you can calibrate a toaster to the amount of toast in it, but it seems like somehow they have, so it makes me think that other settings I haven't tried yet (like Bagel or Pizza) are a lot more likely to work than I would have expected otherwise.<br /><br />My wife saved some fries from a burger joint, which I've never been able to successfully revive later. On a lark, I popped them in on convection mode the next day, and they actually came out with a nice crisp exterior, basically as good as when they were fresh, but a little browner. I really didn't think it was possible to revive fries.<br /><br />I've been a human factors (usability) engineer for many years, and I have to say that I've run across few products that I thought were better functionally designed than this one. It's not drop-dead simple, because it provides too many features to be a \\""one-touch\\"" device, so if your grandma can't dial out on the cell phone you got her, it might not be right for her either. But they've done an elegant job of presenting all the functionality of a rather feature-laden device.<br /><br />I wish it came with the $40 cutting board accessory that fits on top of the unit.  I'm planning to get one, but am kind of wondering whether that will have any effect on the cooking times since it will add a certain insulation factor. And I wish they made an oven model that was tall enough to realistically roast a full sized chicken, which I'm not sure this will quite handle. But overall, this is giving me about as much joy as I think I'm willing to admit I can get from a small appliance.librate a toaster to the amount of toast in it, but it seems like somehow they have, so it makes me think that other settings I haven't tried yet (like Bagel or Pizza) are a lot more likely to work than I would have expected otherwise.

I have to tell you ..some of the people in here were incorrect about the glass pans and the fact that you cant use foil in these ovens. I personally called a customer service rep at Breville and they dont want you to put  the pan close to the heating elements with foil on them because it could catch fire. You can still use foil but make sure the foil isnt touching the upper or lower elements My suggestion for all of you is to call the Breville company and ask them to clarify some of these issues people are having with their ovens. These people are complaining about things inaccurately. I just received this oven and I am impressed with the design...very stylish, easy to use, easy to clean and if you read the directions..easy to operate! As far as the oven getting hot.TOASTER OVENS GET HOT! If you have kids, you shouldnt be allowing the young ones near the oven in the first place. The door gets very hot when its in operation and even with your conventional oven you still have to use potholders to pull the food out of the hot oven. If you people dont understand that all toaster ovens get hot then you just have been expecting to get a oven like your built in wall ovens or your range ovens. People who have owned toaster ovens KNOW they GET HOT! The fact that this oven cooks faster , heats up faster and is \\""convenient\\"" AND saves you money on electric is a real benefit.One other thing I sometimes wonder about is if the people complaining about products on here that they arent employees of a competitor trying to damage their reputation. Finally ..FOLKS USE COMMON SENSE..you dont let your kids around the stove or the oven when its on..this is an oven...keep your children away from it when its in operation. Now we will see how long this oevn lasts..thats the real test. If you are in the market for a oven like this ..compare the ovens and if you are really concerned about an issue the appliance may be having..call the company. I even called cuisinart to ask them about concerns folks had with their ovens and the customer service rep told me that alot of these complaints are very inaccurate. The only issues i had with the large cuisinart ovens is the crumb tray pulls out from the back and i think thats a terrible design flaw.be having..call the company.

Horrible quality for the price,"I have been a heavy user of convection toaster ovens for about 10 years.  they are such a great appliance because they heat quickly and don't heat up the whole kitchen.  After having owned the Breville for 9 months now, I am going to buy a new Cusineart, I think.  I just can't stand it anymore.  The Breville has a number of problems that it should not have at this price point:<br /><br />1. Only goes up to 450 degrees.  This is not suitable for broiling or pizza.<br />2. Does not heat evenly evenly with the Convection feature on.  The fan is just not powerful enough.  Cookies, pizza, chicken, etc. will get crisped on the edges while the middle of the pan is raw/underdone.<br />3. Bottom elements are going after 9 mo (took my Cuisinart TOB 165 6 years before this happened) so only the top side of the toast is browned and I have to turn it.  They were never very powerful to begin with, yet they are not broken, so probably not covered under the warranty.<br />4.  Does not heat up that quickly.  Takes about 5 min when I was used to about 2 with the Cusinart.<br /><br />I originally bought this because it looked so much nicer than the ugly all silver Cuisinarts (why didn't they keep the black/silver model they used to sell!) and got such great reviews.  I have a feeling, many of those reviews were by people who didn't have anything to compare it to, or had a much more inferior oven like a Black and Decker.  For them, I can see it as a revelation like when I bought my first 10 years ago and rarely had to use the big oven ever again.  I was so thrilled that I looked past any flaws, but there is at least one better convection toaster oven out there and it costs less than this one.",2010-11-29

I have upped my rating to four stars because it is a good oven.

The bamboo tray they sell works fine.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW<br /><br />I purchased this oven from Amazon on October 5, 2010. It was easy to set up and worked as described, although the knobs felt pretty cheap for the cost. There was a lot of \\""slop\\"" as I turned them, not the comforting \\""click\\"" I expected.  But, it worked just fine.<br /><br />Yesterday morning it died. Just plain died. I checked the extension cord, tried another outlet, and so on. The oven is dead as a door nail.  We cooked maybe five pizzas, made toast a few times, and reheated some leftovers. Not a commercial duty cycle!!!<br /><br />I am past the Amazon return window, so I have to deal with the manufacturer.<br /><br />Stay tuned. I cannot recommend this oven. I will update my post after the manufacturer has the opportunity to replace this defective unit.<br /><br />Update 1. It is 5:15 PM CST on Monday, 11/29/10. I have been on hold for 15 minutes with the Breville USA toll-free number, 10866-273-8455. The good news is they have that catchy elevator music, and every few minutes a female voice says, \\""Please stay on the line. Your call is very important to us. Your call will be answered in the order it was received.\\""  Or something like that.<br /><br />The toll-free message says to email them and they will respond within one business day.

I loved it.  I used it about four or five times.  I made toast and I cooked a pizza in it.  Everything was fine, until I went to cook another pizza.

Very good taste and consistency.<br /><br />It would have been interesting to let the cookies bake another minute or two in the big oven and compare taste.  But this was more of a test of the claim that convection cooking results in faster cooking times.  Not only is that claim true, but also the preheat time is less than half of the big oven.  The Breville is a big win in my book and I can't wait to start cooking other meals with it.<br /><br />Edit:<br />I have been using this product for about 4 months now.

I had doubts about paying $160 (refurbished)for an appliance designed to compete in a price range where $75 is a lot to pay for a toaster oven. But with the larger interior volume we have been cooking a lot of stuff we would have normally placed in our regular oven and it is well worth it in convenience and whatever energy savings we achieve.<br /><br />My only criticism is the lack of an interior light (one star deduct for that) and no readout of the actual oven temperature vs. the set temperature.,2010-11-13

Its seemingly small size would indicate only the smallest of pans could be used, but it is a illusion, 8x8 or 9x9 pans can be used, as well as 1/4 sheet pans.  Look at the pizza pan that is included, you would never guess that it would fit in there.<br /><br />Nice stainless steel exterior looks great on my counter top.<br /><br />Observations: Checking the preheated temperature with a calibrated thermometer, I find the preheat temperature to be 20 to 25 degrees off to the low side upon the signal that the oven is preheated. This is probably due to the computer used that prevents a over limit condition, its not something worth worrying about.<br /><br />Now to the negatives I have read in other reviews..<br /><br />\\""The oven is hot on the outside\\""  Yes it gets hot, very hot, that's why you use oven mitts unless you are using the handle. My floor oven can get very hot on the outside also. Remember THIS IS NOT A TOY, keep children away and respect the fact that it gets hot and you will be fine.<br /><br />\\""The knobs seem cheap they have play in them\\""  They are SUPPOSED TO HAVE PLAY IN THEM, Most high end modern knobs have this play, it is designed to keep the heavy handed person from twisting them off!<br /><br />\\""Breville says you can't use foil, glass, this or that in the oven\\""  No, READ THE MANUAL, you can use OVEN RATED GLASS, ALUMINUM FOIL, OR ANY OVER SAFE DISH IN THIS OVEN!, what you can't do is allow the foil glass etc to touch the heating elements, which will cause a fire or break the dish.<br /><br />\\""There is no light in the oven\\"" Give me a break, if you want a small size oven that does big things you cannot put a light in it without adding to the size and expense. Its not a easy bake oven, no need to stare into it.<br /><br />My only con to this item is the depth of the crumb tray which is no more than a indentation in the tray, which will only be a big deal if you have a medium to large spill while inserting a pan containing a liquid.<br /><br />All in all, I am very picky and aside from one minor complaint this oven is the way to go.

However, the control knobs have a loose and cheap feel to them. I feel like I have to be careful with them or else they may come right off. The wobble/play of the control knobs also add to a feeling of imperfect design. They just don't feel solidly attached.<br /><br />All in all, I give it four stars as there are very few ovens out there that combine such attractive styling with interior size and features.

I don't feel like writing a review about how great this product is as many users have already posted why you can't go wrong with this oven.<br /><br />I would like to explain why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />Much like a Turbo Cooker, the convection part of the oven cooks products extremely fast. It does a better job than any Turbo Cooker I've used as it cooks foods very evenly. The issue with this oven is that when cooking things like frozen pizza you need to be absolutely certain that you follow the instructions on the products packaging and DO NOT use the settings of the oven. It will burn your pizza if you go by the built in settings. I see this as a small issue since it renders many of the cooking settings useless out of the box. Thankfully, it isn't an issue that can't easily be fixed by adjusting the default settings.<br /><br />Speaking of settings, I would like to see this oven feature more programmable settings or at the very least a way to rename each setting, and a way to permanently save those settings in case of power failure. I also could not find a reset settings button or a way to restore the oven to factory defaults without unplugging the oven.<br /><br />I'm also a little concerned with how the oven pre-heats as it automatically starts to count down the timer whether or not you insert your food. Even if the oven is empty it will start the countdown timer and begin cooking.<br /><br />The magnetic door is nice but, sadly it only pulls out a rack that is on the middle shelf.<br /><br />This is still a fantastic product. For someone like me that lives in a small apartment with no outside vent this oven completely destroys any Turbo Cooker I've ever used and it makes my standard kitchen oven almost completely useless. I don't even use my microwave anymore.<br /><br />Speaking of microwaves, I think a good compliment to this oven would be a microwave, convection oven. I plan on purchasing one when I find one that is affordable with good reviews.<br /><br />I think the ideal cooking environment for anyone with limited space would be the BOV800XL with the enhancements I suggested coupled with a Convectioin Microwave oven.<br /><br />As others have said, if you are thinking about getting this oven, or an oven like it, or even a turbo cooker.

For years I've complained how badly it bakes cookies. A friend suggested buying a toaster oven and I'm so glad I chose this one! I never use my regular oven anymore.<br /><br />The oven comes with one 12\\"" x 12\\"" pan but it's black enamel and I prefer light-colored cookie sheets so the cookies don't scorch. I had a hard time finding pans that wouldn't touch the inside walls of the oven - all the 9\\"" x 13\\"" pans I found had handles sticking out so the outside measurements were more like 13 1/2\\"". Finally I came across the [[ASIN:B000GXC928 Vollrath Co. Jelly Roll Pan 13x9x1.125-in.]] and I bought two. The pans fit this oven perfectly, although I wish I could find pans that measured something like 11\\"" x 12\\"" so I could take advantage of the full cooking space. With the Vollrath pans I can bake 6 or 8 average-size cookies at a time. I also use the pans for baking French fries, chicken nuggets, pizza, and other frozen foods.<br /><br />I love the convection function. My cookies turn out perfect every time, although I had to adjust my recipes down by about 25 degrees. The manual suggests doing this so it wasn't a surprise. I'm quite the cookie gourmet so I'm thrilled with the results! Every Christmas I give cookie baskets as gifts and I'm excited to try this oven out for my seasonal baking. I like how the oven remembers the last setting so I don't have to reprogram it every time. The controls are easy to understand and operate, even with cookie dough-covered hands. I also really like how the oven shuts off when the timer beeps. If I'm in the next room and I can't get there right away I know my cookies won't turn into hockey pucks. I also like how the timer beeps three times and then stops - I hate how some ovens scream at you until you can reach them. The beeper might be a little quiet if you're not in the same room but in my apartment it's just right.<br /><br />I've also used the oven to bake frozen food. It always turns out nicely crisped but not dry. The broiler function is excellent too, although I recommend turning it on for 10 minutes to warm it up before you put your food in. The only time I had trouble with smoke is when I used a regular pan to broil steak rather than a broiling pan and the grease scorched.<br /><br />My only complaint is how hot the door gets. I've burned my wrist several times pulling food out of the oven, especially using the lowest rack level. Now I make sure I have a full-length oven mitt on before I open the door. I wish they would have put a gasket or something similar on the inside of the door to prevent burns. The handle stands well away from the outside of the door so I don't burn myself pulling it open. I also like how the door is magnetized so the rack pops out when I open it. I also wish it came with a second rack so I could bake two pans of cookies at the same time.

I bought one and loved it.  I gave one to my sister for her birthday and quickly it became the desired item within my family ... In the end I think I purchased 5 of them.  I love well-designed products with simple interfaces.  Analog toasters have a nice simple interface - time, temp, mode (toast / bake / broil).  Digital toasters have better components, but tend to have cluttered and unintuitive interfaces.  This Breville toaster is a nice blend between the two.  The interface is at least as intuitive as a simple analog toaster, but the quality is so much higher.<br /><br />Pro:<br /> * Construction Quality - The construction quality is excellent.  It has a solid feel and is aesthetically quite pleasing.  The handle is nice and wide, and despite a few reviews that mentioned issues with burning one's hand while opening the toaster, I've never had an issue, nor do I fully understand how that would be possible.  The door is balanced such that it opens easily, yet doesn't fall into the counter if you let it go.  The elements are ridiculously over-engineered.  My previous $50 toasters would burn out after a few years when the elements wore out.  Due to the quality of the quartz elements, I don't envision ever having that issue with this device.  It seems solid and built to last.  And the quality and sturdiness provide a simple beauty that makes the over pleasant to look at and use.<br /> * Design & Aesthetics: Controls - The four controls are intuitive and simple - time, temp, mode, GO.  The digitized rotating knobs are faster, more intuitive, and more pleasant than the crappy up/down buttons or number-pad found on most other digital devices.  Toast longer? Spin the bottom knob.  Toast hotter? Spin the top knob.  Toast the same as last time? Press GO. Rather than spinning freely, each knob has discrete positions that are subtle but can be felt tactilely.  Most of the time my oven sits at a single setting, and I just press the GO button, and it works with the simplicity of an old-fashioned toaster.  The \\""GO\\"" button is also the \\""STOP\\"" button - when running, the GO button instantly lights up a red perimeter, making it blindingly obvious ... toggle it back and forth like a light switch and there will be zero confusion what is happening.<br /> * Design & Aesthetics: Display - The display is large, high-contrast, and uncluttered.  When idle, the screen is passive, readable with the lights on, but emitting no light of it's own. Touch any control and the display lights up, readable at any light and or sobriety level.<br /> * Design & Aesthetics: Racks&Magnets - The magnetic bits on the door cause the rack to pull out about half-way when opening the oven  -- this is a nice touch and very convenient in a subtle way that you don't even notice after a few days.  I was a bit surprised at my parent's house when the rack _didn't_ pop out, and I had to reach into the oven to pull out a piece of toast.  To me, that is the hallmark of this device, and indeed of any truly well designed consumer appliance - you stop noticing the features that were so deliberately engineered into it and use it intuitively.  For a longer discourse on the subject, check out \\""The design of everyday things\\"" by Donald Norman.<br /> * 5 High Quality Heating Elements - The 5 elements are excellent.  Being a bit wider, they distribute heat more evenly.  They heat up quickly and do a good job maintaining consistent temp.  Bread will toast consistently to the same level every time and evenly across the surface.  As if that wasn't enough precision, Breville added something called \\""ElementIQ\\"", basically a fancy branding name for the logic that reduces toasting time when the toaster starts hot, providing fairly consistent results between the 1st set of toast and the 2nd despite the difference in starting conditions (cold-start vs hot-start).  They did that right too; the adjustment happens at the beginning and time is still counted in seconds for the actual toasting session.  Want something to keep toasting for longer? Just spin the time knob to the right and the \\""seconds remaining\\"" will keep going up.<br /> * Like a Swiss Army knife, closed. -  The oven has lots of \\""features\\"" - broiling, multi-hour convection baking, a bagel mode, etc - but these modes are all subjugated under that smaller \\""mode\\"" knob.  You could probably bake a turkey in this oven, but I have a real oven for that.  99.99% of the time it sits in \\""toast\\"" mode and does what any $50 toaster would do, just with more elegance, precision, and consistency.  If you are looking for one of those ovens that can multitask, that box is definitely ticked.  The other modes are intuitive too.  Rotate the mode knob and the display shows the list of 10 or so different ways to heat food.  The mode list is one level deep, so no complicated submodes or \\""settings\\"" or anything like that.<br /><br />Con:<br />* The one surprise I had was that there is no \\""full power\\"" mode.  Toast is the only mode to use all 5 elements, but refuses to use convection.  The convection modes use 4 or fewer elements.  Also, toasting temp is measured in slices of bread up to 9, vs the degF temp for the baking modes.  In the first week I had the device, I really wanted to put it through it's paces and run it on HIGH with convection and watch it do to a piece of bread what a magnifying glass under the sun does to an ant. :).  This is sadly not possible.  Even on toast on the highest temp setting, the device does not run at full power.  It uses those 1800 watts to come to temp really quickly, but 1800 watts continuous would probably exceed the design temp by quite a lot and melt something metal.  Don't worry, it will toast quite well.  After the first week, I stopped caring about seeing how much power I could pump into one unsuspecting starch vessel, put the toaster on medium (~6 of 9), and let it give consistent tasty results every morning.  I guess that makes this toaster more Lexus than Fararri.<br /><br />There are a bunch of other high price premium toasters on the market sporting a variety of features.  None of them seem to have the same elegance, simplicity and thought-through design.  Buying a basic $50 analog controlled toaster makes sense if you want to be frugal.  But if you want to take a step up and own a nice appliance, you won't regret this choice.  Just don't make the mistake of splurging $200 on a half-assed hack that has whizz-bang features poorly implemented.  This is the only high-end toaster I've come across that justifies paying a premium.<br /><br />Well done Breville.  In a world with very few truly well designed products, this is one.

And it is a beauty.<br /><br /> For my first project, I decided on pizza. Since my old pizza pan is 16\\"" across and the Breville is 13\\"" I made a simple conversion and prepared 2/3 of my old recipe. OOOOPS. Neglected to consider the 3rd dimension. The new pizza pan is quite flat. I've always made a thick crust pizza. I assembled it and took it over to the oven LEAVING A TRAIL OF PIZZA SAUCE AND CHEESE FROM THE WORK TABLE TO THE OVEN. I popped it in the oven anyway but managed to slobber topping onto the inside of the oven. After cleaning up the floor and counter and my shoes and throwing two pot holders, three oven mitts and the spattered clothes I was wearing into the washer, I enjoyed a very nice pizza. I could have given it a couple of minutes more oven time, consistent with the trial and error method expected with a new product. I won't use the pizza cutting wheel again on the pan, since it marked the surface. The whole pizza could easily be removed from the non stick pan to a proper cutting surface. When the oven was completely cool it cleaned up nicely with a soapy sponge. The crumb tray soaked clean and I put the rack in the dishwasher. Problem solved.  UPDATE --I use my 16\\"" pizza pan in my regular gas oven to make the big, thick crust pizzas we prefer. The pan that came with theBreville oven makes a nice cookie sheet or calzone pan.<br /><br />My next project was to bake a pan of stuffed shells in Italian tomato sauce. It turned out great. Next I baked an apple pie according to my regular cookbook instructions. I used my pyrex pie dish with no problem. It also was a success. Tonight I plan on broiled chicken thighs, baked potatoes -- sigh. Gee, I thought I didn't like cooking.<br /><br />Somehow I thought the baking pan would be big enough to make a nice big cake. It is somewhat too flat for that purpose. I think it's really just  intended for roasting meat and for going under the broiling rack. I do have an aluminum 13 x 9 cake pan which is PERFECT for the Breville.<br /><br />A comment about glass dishes. I WOULD NOT USE ANY GLASS OR CERAMIC ITEM WITH THE BROILER FUNCTION. THE TEMPERATURE IS JUST TOO HIGH. STICK WITH METAL!  Also, do not put glass or ceramic items in the oven while it is preheating. The preheating unit is just too hot. With the other functions, I would feel safe using pyrex or any glass which is intended for a conventional oven. Of course I would NOT put just any old glass or ceramic ware in any oven. For more information on glass cookware, check  the January 2011 issue of Consumer Reports article on \\""Glass Bakeware That Shatters\\"" page 44. Most of these bad experiences have been with use in conventional ovens.<br /><br />Months later: The instruction book is great. Each function is described in clear detail. I chose the Breville over other convection ovens because it can take a 13\\"" pan. It may be a bit crowded, but it is just fine for my needs. There is no need for a separate recipe book or instructions on baking familiar things.  Follow the directions in your cookbook or on the package. I've tried everything I generally bake in this oven and haven't had to make any adjustments.<br /><br />All in all, this oven seems to be a quality piece of equipment that will do whatever you ask it to do.er the broiling rack.

The convection mode is so quiet that I had to put my ear down to the vent to be sure it was on.  I have tried just about every mode and it has not failed me once.  The handle on the cord is genius and wonder why more manufacturers don't do that.  I do keep mine plugged in as it only stays in the ready mode a few minutes before turning off.  It toasts both bread and one half a bagel with ease and have baked cakes and casseroles with great results.  The removable crumb tray is easy to remove and insert and cleans off easily. It is a quality product and I would highly recommend it to anyone.  Have not turned on my big oven since I got it.  Having it handle a 9 x 12 pan is great, as most toaster ovens will not do that. Yes, it is pricey but seems to be well worth the money.  Have had it about a month and have used it every day.  Cleans up nicely and is very good looking on the counter.

I can't find anything else to gripe about.  Since I got it I've tried to throw everything in it that failed in my previous toaster/convection ovens.  Apart from toasting bread and bagels perfectly from fresh or frozen the thing is a small oven rather than a toaster.  Calling it a \\""toaster oven\\"" isn't nearly as accurate as calling it an oven that also toasts.<br /><br />Many convenience foods specifically say not to cook in a toaster oven.  I have tried to do these in other toaster/convection ovens with predictably bad results.  Burned top and bottom with raw inside.  The Breville cooks like my big oven but preheats much, much faster and doesn't heat up the kitchen as much.  It does pizza better than my big oven and reheats leftovers well.  Other items I've tried and baked perfectly:  Baked potatoes, refrigerator biscuits, frozen turnovers, toasted pecans, pot pie, potato casserole and bread.  It heats very evenly and consistently according to my digital probe.  Preheat uses full power but if you increase the temp while cooking, say from 325 to 375, The temp will rise more gradually so it doesn't scorch the food.  That's actually smarter than my big oven which will now be used only for cooking things too big for the Breville oven or things that splatter or leak (the big one is self cleaning, I'm lazy).<br /><br />It's only a month old but zero complaints so far.  The bamboo cutting board for the top was worth buying.  Bite the bullet and spend the extra money for something that does what it's supposed to.  I'm glad I bought the bigger one.",2010-09-02

It replaced my microwave so it took some getting used to being that using real heat is different than microwaves. I certainly feel safer in my kitchen now. After reading lots of reviews and seeing some of the competition's ovens on a retail floor, the Breville was a clear winner. It heats up fairly quickly and cooks very evenly. The supplied cooking pans are very convenient too. The hot trays do tend to slide out when you don't want them to so be careful. And the sliding shelf hangs up a bit where it gets pulled magnetically on the door. Also, compared to a microwave, the outer case gets hot so nothing can be on top of it or touching it, like the power cable. I am very critical of control feel and I find that even though light, the controls are well made and easy to use as you select desired modes, temps and times.

Thus four stars - but beware! What if you don't want to cook toast, bagel, baked goods, roast or pizza? I resent being programmed into just cooking what the designer wants me to. For example this oven has no setting I've been able to discover that will do frozen thick cut steak fries. Broil doesn't do it - the elements go dark halfway through the browning process, resulting in dried out pallid fries. The only way to get it to even halfway cooperate is to leave the door ajar to trick the thermostat. I'll either have to hang on to my 15 year old $50 Black & Decker (which provides high heat for as long as you need it) or use the big oven for a small batch of potatoes. The \\""1800 watts\\"" is deceptive as this only occurs for a fleeting moment during the toast cycle and cannot be applied to my steak fries. The product should either have an unprogrammed setting to just turn it on high for so many minutes, or should clearly state what it won't cook.",2010-08-21

My wife has baked muffins, cakes and pies in it and it performs much better than our expensive (and disappointing) professional gas stove.  All came out perfect.

The heat that the oven puts off in my tiny kitchen is ridiculous! So I have been using toaster ovens for all of my cooking and baking needs lately. My last one broke down so i wanted to upgrade and get a bigger one...So i did my research and came across this model, I have used breville products before, i have been satisfied so i purchased it. It is a perfectly made product. Normally appliances that are digital have a lot of useless buttons and features. But this toaster oven has so many convenient features i have used practically all of them in the short time i have had it. I have never even roasted before and now i am roasting fresh corn and green beans that come out delicious! I can bake 24 medium sized cookies in 11 mins on the fast cookie setting! The size is deceiving, it has a deep back and i have roasted turkey breasts and whole chickens! The pizza pan is great because i prefer the 12 inch size, it is easy even if you are feelin lazy it has a frozen pizza feature! Every time and setting seems to be precise, You really do not need to guess when your using this oven. This toaster oven is well worth the money. I recommend to clean it as you go and not let too much build up, and the top does get very hot. Even the inside of the handle can get too hot to touch so be careful when opening up the door. Try a silicone mat that's oven safe for the top of the oven for extra protection, that is what i did. Works great.

Fortunately I remembered that Amex has an extended warranty feature so I called them & filed a claim.<br /><br />Up until today, I was very pleased with this oven.  However, be aware of the 1 year warranty and the indifferent response by customer service.  Also look into the location of Breville service centers.  They're not centrally located.

I have made perfectly toasted bread, baked a frozen pizza, reheated leftovers and cooked frozen chicken tenders.  I also like the lighted, electronic dials, especially the red light behind the start/stop button when the oven is on.  Now I find that I am looking for reasons to use it.<br /><br />My reason for writing is to give some tips to new users, particularly if there are children around, as this oven gets very hot (as hot as others, I imagine, but it seems more noticeable).  The good thing is that I don't worry now about the surrounding surfaces getting hot or burning, as long as I keep it 4\\"" away from the surrounding walls.  I also don't worry about the oven catching fire, as it seems more well made and sturdier than other ones I have considered.<br /><br />1.  When grabbing the handle, be sure to keep your knuckles from touching the front of the oven.<br />2.  When using the push buttons (like the start/stop button), be sure to use your finger instead of your thumb.  (I accidentally used my thumb while resting my fingers against the side of the oven which was a mistake I won't make again.)<br />3.  The beep at the end of the cooking cycle can barely be heard.  I recommend using a separate timer at times, particularly if you are worried about burning your food.<br />4.  Be sure to pull the handle all of the way down.  If you don't, the spring will snap the handle closed, possibly with your hand inside.<br />5.  Months ago I had the toaster oven outlet in my kitchen changed to a dedicated outlet with a 20 amp breaker.  I'm glad I did because now I don't worry about turning the oven up to 450, the maximum temperature of the oven.  (My old oven and microwave were on the same circuit before I fixed the problem, and I couldn't use both at the same time.) Keep in mind that this is an 1800 watt oven. (Whoo hoo!)<br />6.  Because the oven gets hot and I often place items on top of the oven, I decided to get the matching cutting board which fits nicely on top of the oven.  It is a pretty good looking cutting board.

I read all the positive reviews and video demos on the Breville toaster oven before deciding to purchase it. I was very excited when the oven arrived a few days later.  My wife and I setup the toaster oven immediately and she was ready to cook her first pizza.  We followed the instructions and had a mostly burnt pizza for our first try.  I then tried toasting some plain bread and also over did it.  With a little adjusting - usually reducing the heat, time, or both, we had perfectly cooked meals.  The presets are not always best for our items but it is very easy to make manual adjustments.<br /><br />I love being able to toast 6 slices of bread or waffles at a time for the three of us.  We could not believe that we could put a full size Digiorno pizza in this oven.  The convection feature really does cut cooking time by 25-35%, so adjust your settings accordingly.  The pizza tray gets used in our household almost every day and is easy to clean.  The baking tray and broiler has been used for fried chicken, salmon, and much more.<br /><br />One feature that sets this toaster oven apart is that you set the temperature and time.  Once the oven is fully preheated, it beeps and the time begins to countdown.  Once the time is up, the oven shuts off.  No more worrying about setting a separate timer and having to remember to shut off the oven when an item is fully cooked.  My wife used to be paranoid that our old toaster oven was not turned off.  No more worries and no more overcooked food (as long as you set the temperature and time right. I also like being able to adjust the temperature and time during cooking.<br /><br />This oven is used daily and is much more useful than our full sized oven as it cooks faster and probably saves on our utility bill.

The toasting element is inconsistant across the interior surface by at least 1 setting.  If you put 3 pieces of toast\bagels across the interior rack, the center section of the unit will toast the bagel\bread to a crispy brown while 80% of the surface of the toast on each side will be warm\hot but at least a setting behind in browning.  Second observation.  The unit is larger than most toaster ovens and multiple task ovens that I have had in the past -- so it seems to eat up counter space.  After 20 years in my home with lots of counter space, this is just a little larger than I would like in this apartment, and it basically consumes all the horizontal contertop between the frig and oven.<br /><br />But I love the design and looks of the unit, and the crumb\drippings tray on the bottom it top drawer when it comes to easy cleaning\use, and with 450% baking plus a higher setting for broil it satisfies all of my baking needs.

Give it a quick wipe and it's clean. And it's so roomy inside that a 5-pound chicken would fit in easily.  After I've used it a while I might find some shortcomings, but for now it's exactly what I need to completely ignore my big regular oven.  Good riddance!",2010-07-20

It is easy to see the quality of this product.  The design of this oven strongly suggests that those who did it actually used toaster ovens a lot.  It was bought because living alone, it was a waste of energy to be heating up my regular sized oven for the small items I was eating.  Not only should it save energy, but it heats up things like left-over frozen pizza very fast.  I have only had it a few months, but I have not had any problems with it.  And except for larger items that I have to use in my regular oven, I am using this oven exclusively.  I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in buying a toaster oven. It is one of the best products I have bought.  The only thing I would caution potential buyers about is that the owner's manual states that it is best to have about 4 inches of space around the over to avoid heat damage to things like walls, cords, etc.  I don't know how true this is, but I move it out away from the wall a few inches every time I use it because it is easy to do so.",2010-07-15

The handle is far enough away from the door to protect your knuckles from singing.  Magnets on the door pull the rack out part way when in the middle position.  I love that.

Yes it is expensive, but you know that when you buy it. If you think it costs too much, look elsewhere.<br /><br />I only used previous toaster ovens for toasting and reheating and they never seemed to do a very good job on either of those, even a couple of \\""fancy\\"" ones that I bought. I use the Breville for toasting, reheating, baking, broiling and roasting and it does an excellent job on all of them. I'm single and cook for one or two and the size is nearly ideal for me. I use it daily and it has almost replaced my larger oven. Yes, it could be an inch wider and and an inch higher inside, but that's always the case and following that path gets you back to a full sized oven. I don't really miss a light inside. Mine also runs about 25 degrees too low, but no problem once I learned to compensate.<br /><br />My only concern is longevity as small kitchen appliances seem to really be made to a price these days, but I've used it for eight months now and it is still as good as the day that I bought it.<br /><br />I'm confused by the comment from a previous reviewer who said \\""The on/off button no longer functions.

Great oven, love the look and features, only a very few small dislikes:<br /><br />1) The convection fan in the oven I purchased makes a grinding noise as it spins down. I can hear the fan blades hitting something inside. It doesn't sound major and I don't feel like dealing with the hassle of boxing it up and shipping it back, so I decided to keep it anyway and if it breaks before the warranty runs out i will just ship it off to Breville. I might even open it up myself and adjust the fan blades, I'm sure its something very simple.<br /><br />2) No oven light. At this price point an oven light would be very nice, its annoying to have to open the oven door and let all the heat out to check on the food, I sent my suggestion to Breville and they said they will consider it for future models.<br /><br />3) Shows fingerprints and stains very easily. Not sure what it is, but there are a lot of little dots around the base of the oven door. I know its stainless steel and stainless steel shows everything, but I have a trashcan that is also stainless steel and it advertised no smudge marks...4 months later still not even a single fingerprint is showing on the trashcan, not sure what they did to accomplish that, but it would definitely help if this oven used that material.<br /><br />4) The timer is not very loud and as soon as the oven reaches operating temperature it immediately begins counting down. This for me is the most annoying feature by far. I've never had an oven where I had to scramble to get the food in as soon as the timer sounded. I can understand maybe its a power saving feature; if you do not hear the timer it will shutoff once the countdown reaches zero, but I would rather if they had just made it so that it would shut off after 5 min of reaching operating temp if the door hadn't been opened or something more logical like that. Since the ready alarm is not very loud its easy to miss the alarm.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Even after all the minor things I do not like, I still like this oven enough to give it 4 stars. The fit and finish are just what I was looking for, it cooks extremely fast, and has no problem staying on temp even with a full tray of chicken breasts in it. The display glows an attractive blue, and the dials are super easy to use. If it weren't for the timer issue I would probably give it 5 stars anyway.after all the minor things I do not like, I still like this oven enough to give it 4 stars.

Some of the purchasers aren't reading the manual that comes with this oven.<br />Myth #1....you can't use foil. Yes, you can, it just can't touch the heating elements, or the oven overheats. I always use foil to line pans for easy cleanup.<br />Myth #2....you can't use glass pans. Yes ! you can if they are oven proof. Both of these facts are pointed out in the owner's manual. I've even used Corelle bowls to reheat a quick lunch and even that worked great.<br /><br />This oven does get hot, I read a lot of reviews before I purchased and this was one fact that was pointed out over and over again. It does get hot but not any worse than my old lousy toaster oven that I just threw away.<br /><br />I purchased this oven for a few reasons, the first being that my little toaster oven was driving me crazy with the alternating burning and undercooking foods. Then my \\""new\\"" microwave died and I decided to toss that forever and just use this oven. I actually put the Smart Oven in the microwave cabinet, which is not recommended in the manual but it did state that there is a minimum of clearance around the sides and top of 4 inches.....and in my big cabinet there is 6 inches of space on each side of the oven. There is plenty of airspace to vent around it. I wouldn't have any more space around it if it were on my countertop under the cabinets. Downside: I have to stand on a stool to read the LCD display and put items in/out, because it is elevated.<br /><br />I have to get used to the quick cooking time of this oven but other than that, I think it's great. Bagels, muffins, toast all come out to perfection....this thrills me after years of having to stare at the toaster oven so I didn't burn breakfast. I love the many settings and it is all very easy to use.<br />I baked salmon in it last night and it came out just as good as when I make it in my conventional oven. (and I used foil to line the pan !)The family didn't know the difference!<br />Pizza comes out great. I am really considering getting the pizza stone.<br />I don't really miss my microwave....I've adapted by just using the stovetop to melt butter and use the Smart Oven for my reheating needs....and anything else isn't important enough to compare for the extra space I now have since I tossed the toaster oven and microwave.<br /><br />So all in all I love this oven....it is super quiet, very efficient, and although I have to get used to the speedy baking/reheat times, I really feel like I will be getting a LOT of use out of this little appliance.

This oven is not only attractive, but is so well thought out functionally that it is worth every penny.  My former bagel oven had a timer/dial that had marks on it, and you had to pretty much guess where to turn the dial to get the darkness you desired on your bagel.  The Breville is digital, so you select a number to determine darkness.  Once you establish your desired number/darkness, it does a perfect toasting every time.  Plus, the oven has several functions: toast, bagel, bake, roast, broil, pizza, cookies, reheat, and warm.  You can select convection on several of these features, or just stay with conventional baking.  There is a button you can push if your bread is frozen, and the oven will automatically adjust the time for toasting.  I love to toast nuts for baking, and this oven (on the toast setting) does a fantastic job.  I haven't noticed that the oven gets particularly hot on the top or sides with just a few slices of toast, but longer baking does make the oven too hot to comfortably touch.  Since my oven sets underneath cabinetry which has light fixtures just above, I have purchased the optional bamboo cutting board which rests perfectly on top of the oven.  This helps to insulate the plastic lenses on the under-cabinet light fixtures.  A great feature is the oven rack, which automatically pulls half-way out via a pair of magnets.  This feature only works when the rack is at the middle level, but this is the most-used level in my household.  I just can't say enough good things about this oven.  It's a keeper!!",2010-05-24

While not as retro in look as the Dualit, it's a handsome, extremely sturdy, and very attractive appliance. Everything about it seems to have been well thought out for both ease of use and functionality. The clear read-out gives a great deal of control over time, temperature, degree of browning, and so on, and is easy to work with.

We previously owned an American Harvest Jet-Stream oven (countertop convection oven) which gave us many years of excellent service. We were able to purchase three replacement tops for it over the years, but noticed that the last two we bought were much flimsier that the originals. We thought about getting another Jet Stream oven since ours was so old. The reviews for the new ones were not as good as for the original ones (now owned by another company), so we decided to look for a regular convection/toaster oven.<br /><br />In reading as many online reviews as possible, we found that the Breville Smart Oven consistently got excellent reviews. We chose this oven based on numerous consumer reviews that gave it top marks. The fact that it is more expensive than all others we considered is more than justified by its quality and the excellence of of its performance. We purposely waited several months to write this review because we felt that using it only a few weeks was not a real test of dependability and quality.<br /><br />This is truly a little oven, not just a toaster oven. We have reduced the use of our full-sized oven by about 75%, making The Smart Oven an energy efficient money saver. It also does not heat up the kitchen which will be a great feature this summer. The oven is heavy, sturdy and works great. Numerous settings make it easy to choose a cook time, temperature setting and method of cooking.  Everything that is preset is ajustable. The dials are large and easy to use.  The blue display is easy to read.  The top does get hot, as others have noted, so do not touch it or leave things on top of it while cooking (the intruction book says that you can place ceramic plates on top while cooking to use it as a plate warmer).  It is also deep due to the semi-circle area on the back that allows for the pizza pan to fit.  We first put it at the end of one counter, but the front came out almost to the edge of the countertop and since we have small grandchildren who visit frequently, we decided that we needed to put it elsewhere.  We settled on a corner of our L-shaped countertop and placed it there diagonally. That provides space for the part on the back that butts out for the pizza pan. There is 5\\"" of space between the top of the oven and the bottom of the cabinets.  The cabinets have not gotten hot and there is extra counter space in front when we open the door. When the timer runs out, the oven resets to the original setting but does not turn back on unless you push the start button. We always unplug it after using it.<br /><br />The stainless steel is practical as well as beautiful. We really like the magnetic feature on the door that partially pulls out the rack on the middle shelf (\\""auto-eject\\"").  It helps when removing hot pans as we do not have to reach in to get them. We also like the sturdy handle on the door. The oven comes with two pans: a 13\\"" non-stick pizza pan and a 12\\"" square enameled pan with removable broiler tray that fits on top of the pan. Additional pans made for toaster ovens are available from other manufacturers, as well as a silicone liner to help clean up spills. Many are sold on Amazon. I have used cake pans in the oven but the use of glass pans is not recommended. I have read that you can use them up to 350* without a problem, but I have not tried that. The crumb tray removes easily and the glass door wipes clean easily.  It makes beautiful toast (up to 6 pieces) and bagels.  We have also cooked meat, heated prepared foods, baked potatoes and baked brownies and biscuits and other pastries.  It is very handy for broiling open-faced sandwiches. I will say that the convection feature (which you can turn off) does not cook as fast as our old Jet-Stream oven, but it is faster than baking w/o convection.<br /><br />The oven arrived double-boxed in very sturdy packing and shipping was free. The instruction booklet is very thorough and easy to understand.<br/><br />All in all, we are extremely pleased with the oven and highly recommend it.<br /><br />UPDATE:  It has been over seven months since I posted the original review. We are still extremely pleased with this beautiful, dependable counter-top oven and have not experienced any problems with it. We use it daily, usually several times a day, and I have started using it to reheat most leftovers.  They come out great. The big oven is now only used for large size items and pans too big for the Breville. I read several posts about temperature problems, but we have never noticed a problem with underdone food.  Our unit works great and we still highly recommend it.<br /><br />ANOTHER UPDATE: We had a couple of problems develop about three months ago (summer 2012).  The timer and thermometer settings suddenly quit working right (round dials).  I contacted Breville and even though our oven was out of warranty, they replaced it with a refurbished oven right away at no cost to us (thanks, Breville!).  The \\""new\\"" oven has computer updates that corrects the failing controls.  It has a six-month manufacturer's warranty and so far, it is working very well.  It looked brand new and came with new pans and operation manual.  The only difference is that the display light is amber now, instead of blue.  My guess is that this would alert the manufacturer that it is refurbished.  Other than that, everything is the same.  The turn-around time was about two weeks and while it was down (then gone), we really missed it.  I did not realize how much we use it until it was gone and we had to turn to the big oven again!

After months of use for a replacement to our H.B. that was terrible at toasting evenly and worse at baking, we have seldom turned on our larger Oven/stove unless we were entertaining a large group.  The cooking is so even it has made us question our freestanding ovens quality since it is shamed by the Breville smartoven.  Toast comes out crisp on the surface and soft and moist inside, loafs approach those from a bakery in both texture and pure enjoyment of the moist steamy inside.  We have managed Shepards Pie, fresh breads, side by side quiche, cakes, cookies and various other off the shelf concoctions and frozen pizzas both with the provided pan and right in the rack.  Each new meal validates to my wife why I wanted to buy this oven over another disposable version from a big-box retailer.  We thought that toaster ovens were a convenience item and not a valid cooking toll until this oven was inserted in our kitchen.  Since our Brother and Sister-in-law have purchased the same oven and are absolutely sold on the quality and ease of use.<br />Don't let the manual intimidate you, the oven couldn't be easier to use, the manual will only make you better at each function if you haven't used them before.  After the initial preparation, the oven is a snap to clean and keep-up.<br /><br />If you are debating a new oven or thinking this would be a good present, stop thinking, it is the single best toaster I have ever seen and used.  My family agrees as they have now eaten dozens of meals out of it and notice the difference.  Even our English muffins in the morning taste better using the \\""bagel\\"" setting they are crispy on the inside and soft and chewy on the outside much like those served in a shop not my kitchen.<br /><br />Buy this oven and you will not be dissappointed, the pre-heat time is less than 5 min. to 450 deg.  The timer is simple and shuts the oven off if you get sidetracked (having 2 kids at home I do often) saving your meals from utter dissaster, and the footprint is half of those other ovens while keeping the interior size more than ample for all but large poultry or tall baking cakes.if you get sidetracked (having 2 kids at home I do often) saving your meals from utter dissaster, and the footprint is half of those other ovens while keeping the interior size more than ample for all but large poultry or tall baking cakes.",2010-04-14

Well, let me explain.<br /><br />This toaster oven is just like every other toaster oven you have ever used in most ways. It has a little burner element, a grill, a broiler, a little glass door so that you can see the toast cooking inside. Basic (inexpensive) components of every toaster oven you have ever had.<br /><br />Yet, this toaster oven is better because it was designed more intelligently. They designed a removable crumb tray that is easily accessible from the front. They put a magnet in the door to pull out the grill (when it is at certain heights). The put a fan in the back and called it a 'convection' toaster oven. Most importantly, they put in a sophisticated digital timer.<br /><br />What is so important about a timer? Well, the way they designed this one, operating this toaster oven becomes similar to operating a microwave oven. Having built in settings for toast, pizza, etc, makes getting the correct setting easier, and makes the unit feel like a convenient appliance, unlike your old toaster. Other things complement this convenient microwave-like concept, like a 'frozen' button to use with frozen foods, and a 'push on' power button like most microwaves. That's what makes this timer so important, so sophisticated, and so transforming a feature that many folks are just gushing over this toaster. They think it is the best thing since sliced, er toast.<br /><br />But look at the price tag of this unit. For this price, you would expect it would be built well. After all, Breville is an Australian company, right? Well, the major drawback is the poor quality of components. The whole unit is made in China. The knobs, buttons, and dials of this unit are pathetic. When you 'spin' the dial to select your function, like pizza or toast, you can hear a strange squeaky sound, and the turn doesn't have even resistance. You would think they would put in a simple quality stepped turn switch, but they must have gone with the cheapest thing they could buy, because it is awful. The two larger round knobs, which dial in temperature and time are also of low quality, possibly of lower quality than the previous dial. I have a hard time timing my frozen pizza to 11 minutes. It usually goes from 12 to 9 with the slightest fraction of a turn, while going from 22 (the default time) down to say 18 is pretty smooth. These dials also make a little noise, and they feel a little wobbly (even though they aren't). Even the 'push on' power button doesn't seem to be activate as easily now as it did when I first purchased it a few months ago. Even the plastic of the knobs and buttons feels thin and cheap.<br /><br />These knobs are so bad, I don't even want company using this thing. I am embarassed by it.<br /><br />They fact that they chose to skimp on an item which will receive a lot of wear and tear doesn't make me very confident in this purchase. I've also found that the oven has to be unplugged (display reads E2) after every slight flicker in power, which makes me worry about the longevity of the timer. Without the timer, this oven would be fairly mundane...<br /><br />The problem with this toaster is that it could have been made more sturdily. If they had invested a larger percentage of the purchase price in the cost of materials, I would have been much more satisfied. As is, you are paying for a lot of good ideas on a toaster, which seem to me to be executed as cheaply as they could get away with.<br /><br />I consider this a poor value for your money, but a neat toaster that I hope will not break down any time soon.turn switch, but they must have gone with the cheapest thing they could buy, because it is awful.

In the six weeks of owning it, I am thoroughly pleased with its performance.  It is of solid construction and simply gorgeous!  The stainless steel exterior really shines and pops out in the kitchen.  The door is heavy and solid which speaks to its quality.  The roasting pan, although a minor addition, is also of high quality.  The controls are simple, easy to read, and provide a glowing blue asthetic to an already beautiful piece of machinery.  The Breville offers even roasting and is large enough to bake a medium sized pizza (frozen or from scratch).<br /><br />Side bar - While in college, I worked in Macy's housewares department and thought it didn't get much better than a DeLonghi or Krups.  But after my Krups stainless steel toaster/convection oven mysteriously quit working after two years, I felt it was time to invest in the highest rated oven on the market.  This led me to the Breville.  If you have the money to invest and using a toaster/convection oven is a necessity (as it is with any bachelor), I highly recommend this product!!

The convection oven works beautifully - we've made cookies (need to vary time and temp from default settings) and made roasts, warmed up leftovers and we haven't found a thing we don't like.

The top and bottom elements were not balanced and were very close together, so the oven had hot spots. They were a great idea, but not very practical.<br /><br />Not this one.<br /><br />The toaster oven comes with a 13\\"" round pizza pan and 12\\"" square pan. Our 8 and 9\\"" baking pans fit well. These were the first features that caught our eye.<br /><br />When we got to a store to touch one, it was amazing. Not the flimsy door that we were used to. This door is secure on its hinges, and the door frame is rigid. We opened and closed it repeatedly with delight.<br /><br />We read that we would need a dedicated 20-amp electrical circuit for this appliance. We planned to add one to our kitchen annex, but when we found one that was conveniently located in the middle of the kitchen (where we used to have our fridge), we used that instead and did the necessary rearranging. We replaced the 15-amp receptacle with a 20-amp one for safety.<br /><br />When we brought it home to try it out, how nice to see the elements glowing at variable powers so the food came out evenly cooked. How nice that it pre-heats so quickly because of the high wattage! As for clean-up, the wire rack slides out and wipes off easily. So does the crumb-catcher tray in the bottom! The pans that are included wipe off easily with a soapy sponge, too! We have had no need to expose them to the harsh dishwasher.<br /><br />We easily fit a large tortilla or 4 large bagel halves. I read the manual before using it because I was intimidated by the dials, but I found that using the dials was very easy to figure out without the instruction manual. At first, I often forgot to turn the oven on after setting the dials, but I quickly got in the necessary habit.<br /><br />Fast pre-heating is a great feature. We get impatient waiting for the full-sized oven to pre-heat. We also noticed that the oven stays relatively cool on the outside during use. Even when I put a serving plate on top, it doesn't get very hot. I feel like we're saving a lot of money on electricity by using this instead of the toasters and full-sized oven.<br /><br />The convection feature is controlled by a switch. We leave it on because we got used to it with our full-sized oven and like it.<br /><br />So, this is one more review to increase your confidence as you consider whether this oven is really worth its price. We have no regrets.<br /><br />Added 8/2010:<br />Without warning, the display light stopped working. I called Breville. The customer service rep sent me a FedEx label and told me to box up the stove to return it at no cost to me. She said that within 2 days after they see that I sent it back to them, they would send me a brand new one. Sure enough, within a week I had a new stove. This one is even better!

The purchaser bought it from Amazon (much cheaper than the fancy kitchen store where we had been admiring it in person).<br /><br />I have been thrilled with this oven, and have used it pretty much every day.  My favorite things about it are:<br />*Warms up very quickly, within about 2 minutes to a temp of 350, which speeds up food prep time considerably<br />*Has lots of relevant pre-sets (guess that's part of why it's a Smart Oven); we use the toast, bagel, and pizza ones regularly<br />*Convection feature cooks much faster and more evenly (especially frozen foods, which tend to cook in 1/2 the time)<br />*Neat magnetic feature that pulls out metal rack (protecting fingers)<br /><br />The oven perfectly fits a 12\\"" frozen pizza, and I sometimes use the oven to make a hands-free grilled cheese sandwich (two slices of bread with cheese in the center, push \\""toast\\"" and within 4 minutes, a perfect sandwich).  The oven is large enough that you could easily lay out 6 slices of toast or 6 bagel halves.<br /><br />We keep the toaster oven unplugged when not in use, which leads to a very loud \\""beep, beep\\"" when it is plugged in (annoying when you want to make early-morning toast while others are sleeping).  The oven also gets very hot on the outside (which the salesman at the fancy kitchen store erroneously told us would not happen).  I'm here this week to pick up the coordinating [[ASIN:B002XTBZK0 Breville Smart Oven Cutting Board and Serving Tray BOV800CB]] to put on top.<br /><br />This was my first-ever toaster oven, and while I believe in buying quality kitchen products (they make cooking so much easier and more fun), I'll admit I cringed a bit at the price tag.

The unit signals you when it reaches the temperature that you select but I discovered that everything was undercooked.  I used an oven thermometer and found that an expected 350 temperature signal rang when the actual oven temperature was 225.  I tested this in various oven settings and it was always the same.  Tech support was terrible.  They first blamed it on my oven thermometer (a new Taylor) and said they would test it with the same thermometer.  They promised a call in a two days.  No call.  I called again and was promised another call back.  They did not keep their word.  Each time they seemed to deny there was a problem.  I called today and after giving my case number was on hold for 20 minutes.  I was asked for the third time the same questions. FINALLY they agreed to send another unit.  We shall see.<br /><br />This may be a good unit if it works out of the box but if you have to deal with Breville customer service - good luck!<br /><br />FOLLOW UP<br /><br />After many go-rounds with customer service, they exchanged the unit. The same problem persisted.  I went through another round of unhelpful people at customer support and finally spoke to someone who claimed to be an expert. He told me the manual is wrong when it states \\""Once the oven has reached the set temperature, the temperature alert will sound.\\""  He claimed that things will cook properly even though the oven temperature is not what you set it at.  We agreed I would try it his way as a test. I baked a Trader Joe's Eggplant Parmesan. The instructions stated to bake it for 45-50 minutes at 400 degrees. I set the oven for 400 and put it in when the bell rang. (Actual oven temperature was 275.) After 50 minutes the food was lukewarm in the center and needed 10 more minutes.  Remember convection ovens are supposed to cut baking time - not increase it.<br /><br />Breville offered to send me another oven but I had had it.  After telling my story to Amazon (which included me calling them in Australia), they agreed that I could get a full refund even though I was beyond the exchange period.

It took me 6 months & 3 toasters. I wanted an oven that could make a pizza (my regular oven takes 20 min just to heat up) as well as toast a bagel and make 3 grill cheese sandwiches at once as I have 3 young children. I also wanted an oven that automatically pulls out the tray as you open the door.  This is important to me for safety reasons. I don't wants my kids to stick their hands all the way inside the oven to get their toast out.<br /><br />Toaster #1) I received a black & decker as a gift and it was awful.  It didn't have the pull out tray;  It didn't toast bread evenly on both sides;  It wasn't large enough to bake a pizza;  My bagels were burnt on the outside and cold on the inside;  I threw that one away.<br /><br />Toaster #2) Then I purhased the very popular Cuisineart from amazon.  All three of my kids and my husband got burned while opening the door. It gets very hot! It didn't have the auto tray pull out, so I had to get a pot holder to pull the tray out;  It didn't bake the pizza well because it wasn't powerful enough, even though it fit the pizza;  And worst of all, every time I needed to clean the crumb tray, I had to turn the whole toaster around because the crumb tray pulls out from the back.  I wrapped this up and returned it.  amazon paid for all shippng charges and it was truly a no hassle return.  thank you amazon!<br /><br />Toaster #3) Then I got the breville.  I love it!  My husband loves it!  My kids love it!  It does it all.  The tray automatically pulls out when the door opens so my kids don't get burned when they want to get their toast out;  It toasts bagels beautifully;  It heats up quickly and bakes pizza nicely;  The crumb tray pulls out from the front so it's very easy to clean (this is BIG!);  It's a little more money that the cuisineart, but well worth it.

I needed a new toaster oven and almost overlooked this one because of the price.  I figured I had a full-sized convection oven so why would I want to pay over $200 for this?  Then I saw it in Bed Bath & Beyond ($250 orig, used a 20% off coupon, got it for $200 plus tax) and realized it wasn't as massive (and it's nice looking!) as I thought it was going to be based on the description. Since reviews were so positive, I decided to take a chance.  The first one we brought home had a defect in the LED lights on the display panel so we took it back and exchanged it.  This one is perfect.  I love to use it to bake potatoes and sweet potatoes in and also fish.  It makes PERFECT toast.  None of that striped or only toasted-in-one-spot appearance that I have experienced with other toaster ovens.  I have not yet made pizza, but am looking forward to trying it out.  The pizza pan and other pieces are great, too.  This is the perfect appliance for anyone, whether you have a small or large kitchen.  I love it for when I don't need the space of a full oven.  I also have made use of the top as a warming area for plates which is nice. Some reviewers have complained of not being able to use glass or foil in the oven.  The pamphlet included with ours said to use only oven-safe glass and when using foil to be sure that no foil touches the heating elements.

I bought this as a replacement for a no-name countertop convection oven that kept dropping the top heating element onto what ever was being cooked.  I didn't knock off any stars for the lack of a light and the weak-feeling control knobs since I was aware of these matters at the time of purchase.  The only gripe is the lack of headroom.  It won't accommodate a whole chicken on a V-rack like to old oven did; I need to either break the bird down or butterfly it in order to clear the top heating elements.  So far It's done a great job with frozen pizzas (on a stone) chickens, skillet breads (using a cast iron pie pan) and braises.  Lodge makes a 2-quart cast iron Dutch oven (they call it a serving pot) that fits the oven like they were designed for each other.  All Clad's braising pan fits nicely too.  Perfect for a one pot meal for two.

After doing a lot of research, I decided to give this oven a try. I am so glad I did.<br /><br />I love the digital settings and the flexibility to change the presets. The oven is much smaller than the one that I had been using, but is plenty large for anything I would want to cook in it. It allows for preheating. So you don't have to adjust cook time or guess when it is preheated. I also like the feature that the rack comes out some when the door is opened. It is so much easier than having to be careful not to get burned to check the food.<br /><br />In addition, the door of my old oven opened to the side. This meant the whole counter in front and much to the side had to be cleared in order to pull out the rack. This one opens down and the door is not very large. So you don't need as much clearance to open it.<br /><br />Tonight I warmed a full meal of meat loaf, vegetables, potatoes, and gravy in a covered corningware dish. and it came out beautifully. Everything was sufficiently warmed through without the burning of anything on the outer edges. Before getting this oven, I would have warmed this in the microwave and everything to the outside would be a bit crisped before the inside was warm.<br /><br />As I had said, I love this oven, and I am looking forward to using it quite often rather than heating up my large oven for smaller dishes. I love the quality of the Breville products and am looking into getting one of their newer grills. Their products are not by any means the cheapest, but most of the time, you get what you pay for.

Size, appearance, and rating were my main concerns for a new toaster.  Anyone who has done toaster research knows that there are not a lot of great ones out there these days.  The ones that look good, or are a reasonable price, or have an upscale brand name, all seem to have problems.  The Breville Smart Oven was on my radar because of it's stellar reviews, but I had initially disregarded it because of the higher price and the larger size.  However, after speaking to my in-laws, whom I trust with all things cooking, and hearing that they just bought this oven using a Bed Bath & Beyond 20% off coupon, and absolutely raved about it, I caved.  I made room on my kitchen counter and successfully persuaded my husband that a $200 toaster was necessary.<br /><br />I am happy to say that I am in love with this toaster.  It is large but not too large.  It looks gorgeous and the buttons and handles are of excellent quality and feel great.  The beeping is not annoying.  Crumb tray is front removing, the wire rack slides out automatically, the display is digital and user friendly, and it has a countdown timer.  The instruction manual is easy to understand.

I would give it 5-stars, but am deducting 1-star for manufacturing quality control issues. Upon unboxing the unit and trying it for the first time, the convection oven sounded unusually noisy -- as if the fan blades had faulty bearings or were hitting part of the internal assembly. Upon closer inspection, I could tell that the front door was cockeyed by several degrees. It appears that the unit was built this way. The parts were clearly out of alignment. I tried to squeeze both ends of the oven together to force the door to align better. It helped very slightly -- but it was still noticeably off. I decided to return the unit and noticed that the display unit at the store showed the same alignment issue -- yet the photograph on the box showed perfect alignment. Clearly, there was some kind of quality control issue -- possibly for this batch -- that wasn't caught at the factory. Fortunately, there was one unopened box left -- and it was readily exchanged for the defective one. Upon inspecting this unit at the store before loading it in my car, it appeared to be considerably better than the other two -- so I took the new one home.<br /><br />With that behind me now, as frustrating as it was to receive a product that was improperly assembled, I'm pleased overall with the toaster oven. While larger than a typical toaster oven, the unit is very intuitive -- and the backlit blue LCD display is bright and easy to read. Like most Breville products, the stainless steel exterior and overall styling are contemporary and clean. With enough room for six slices of bread or a 12\\"" pizza, this will come in handy when you don't want to heat up the whole oven to cook a simple dish or reheat leftovers. With 1800 watts of power, this sucks up a full circuit - so be sure you have a 20-A kitchen circuit, which most modern kitchens have these days. But you may not be able to run two appliances on the same circuit (such as a microwave) while this is on. Make sure you put any other large appliance on a separate circuit from the Breville toaster oven.<br /><br />Other than the manufacturing issues noted above, my only recommended improvement is the feel of the knobs. They look nice -- but they feel like cheap plastic. For a toaster oven this expensive, a couple of heavy-duty metal or heat-resistant silicone-type knobs would add a touch of class to an otherwise functional product. I realize it all comes down to costs -- but the knobs are something you use constantly -- and they cheapen the feel of the product.<br /><br />A nice touch is the recessed magnetic dimples on the inside of the door panel that pull the slide-out tray towards you upon opening the door. This causes the rack to slide out part way, making it easy to place your items -- and remove them without burning your hand on the top heating elements. Such a simple idea, but very convenient. Nice touch!<br /><br />If you buy this product and discover that your door is out of alignment -- or if you hear a clanking noise when the convection fan turns on, then you have a defective unit. Now that I've exchanged mine, the fan is very quiet -- just a purr -- as you'd expect.<br /><br />Overall nice product, but like many appliance manufacturers these days, the QC in some Chinese factories can be inconsistent, as we found with the batch at our local retailer.

Works well.  Looks great.  Saves time and energy ( I believe).  I would make one recommendation to Breville.  After setting the desired temperature and the initial warm up period to reach that temp, I think it would be helpful to allow for the time it takes to place the item to be baked or broiled or whicheverr cooking method is selected, then to be able to set a cook time rather than the cook time automatically starting once the machine is up to temp whether the food has been placed inside or not.

Based on these same reviews we upgraded from an old garage sale Black and Decker to the Breville.  Good decision and the positive reviews are accurate.<br /><br />Outstanding oven, and we've quickly reworked kitchen circuit plans and counter space to give this oven its own permanent home in the house we're building, deservedly so.  If possible, you really need to consider a dedicated circuit for this heavy 1800 watt load. Otherwise, note what other devices you have on the circuit and change/plan accordingly.<br /><br />Only one gripe, and it was pointed out by another reviewer previously.  The rotating knobs are a bit cheap feeling.  To explain: when you first pull this machine out of the box and set it on your counter, you'll be impressed with the fit and finish.  You'll think \\""well this is a nice looking machine - I hope it operates as well as it looks.\\""  Then you'll poke and twist at the knobs, and you'll think something like - \\""the feel of the knobs don't quite match.  They're just... wiggly feeling.\\""  At least that is how we felt.  You'll get over it pretty quickly though, probably shortly after your first few cooking adventures.<br /><br />Nice machine and admittedly one very small gripe, but Breville should source a cleaner feeling knob set and upgrade it to create a near perfect machine.<br /><br />Even knowing about this issue, and the competition available, I certainly would not hesitate to buy the Breville again and highly recommend it.",2010-01-28

It takes forever to pre-heat, and is so large that it is in-efficient for us for every day use.  We also had a problem where it has a fish smell in it and anything we bake in it (such as brownies) taste like fish.  I am sure we just need to use the self-clean function, but that is a 4 hour ordeal.<br /><br />I've been eyeing the Breville for a while and finally decided to bite the bullet after seeing all the great reviews.  I can't be happier with that decision.<br /><br />The unit heats up quickly and it is the perfect size for what we want to do as a daily use kitchen appliance.<br /><br />Toast comes out perfect (thanks to the \\""select the number of slices\\"" function) and frozen foods (such as pizza and pizza rolls) come out perfect and able to be eaten fairly quickly (not over baked nor hot).<br /><br />Another commenter said it might be a good idea to put the oven on its own electrical circuit.  I would actually agree with that, but it is not necessary.  This oven shares the circuit with our fridge and I do notice the fridge light flickers while the oven is on.  So, it looks to use quite a bit of power when on.<br /><br />We've only had it a short time but have made brownies from scratch, frozen pizza, frozen pizza rolls, other frozen foods, and fish in it.  Oh, and of course, toast and waffles.  Because of the built-in timer and auto-off, you pretty much set it and forget it.<br /><br />I did buy a 13\\"" pizza stone from here (Fox Run 13-Inch Pizza Stone) that works and fits great for this oven.  I have seen random complaints about the bake/broiler pans that come with the unit being too thin and flimsy.  I am thinking the Breville folks fixed that issue because the pans that came with my unit are super heavy duty -- I could probably knock someone out with them if I clocked them with one.<br /><br />The only complaint I have, and this is not a fault of the unit, is that I have a hard time knowing when to use the convection function or not.<br /><br />Summary: time saver, easy to use, daily appliance, enjoyable, cooks greatthe convection function or not.

We've used it  many times in the few days we've had it and are loving it. The quick start instructions and the brief manual are well-written and easy to follow.  Since this oven is somewhat different (with convection) than a regular toaster oven, a little study of the easy instructions gets the user off on the right foot. The unit is very well constructed and not tinny or cheap in any way. Yesterday we roasted a beef roast and baked potatoes using the default \\""roast\\"" setting (with the convection feature on). Since the roast was frozen,we hit the defrost button, too. Then the oven defrosted the roast and then cooked it to perfection. The accompanying Idaho potatoes roasted much better than our conventional  gas oven, making the skins crispy and the inside of the potatoes exceptionally fluffy and thoroughly cooked. The unit is easy to keep clean with non-stick insides and excellent baking, roasting and pizza cookware. The unit cooks food faster than other ovens, especially when convection is turned on, and browns roasted and baked items beautifully. Our microwave oven can't do that.

It did a fairly descent job with convection baking, but it's manual wind-up knob timer control was horrible for toast--- even if you set it to what looked like the same spot on the dial, toasting results would vary wildly between barely toasted and burnt to a crisp.  After 4 years of swearing at it, I finally decided to invest in a higher-quality oven.<br /><br />The Breville is wonderful!  Superb quality, precise and very readible controls, and excellent results-- I think I can now use this for nearly all my oven cooking needs and forget about my full-sized oven.<br /><br />The Oster was nearly as big as the Breville, and yet could not fit a standard 12\\"" pizza pan in it-- the Breville can (and it even includes a nice non-stick pizza pan).  I also like the heavy, durable broiling tray and pan that is included as well.<br /><br />Like every other toaster oven on the market, it does get hot on all sides and there is no light inside.  But the Breville features more internal heating elements than others, so when they're all on (like when toasting), they provide pretty good illumination, so I don't find the lack of a light any kind of drawback.  The top of the oven allows you to warm plates or keep other foods warm while cooking-- a nice touch.<br /><br />Yes, this Breville was over twice as expensive as the run of the mill Oster, GE, and Black&Decker models, but if you really want a quality, efficient model that can do everything as well as (or better than) a full-sized oven, this is the one to buy!",2009-12-30

This one seemed to be what I wanted.  It arrived quickly as always with Amazon but the first thing I noticed was that the door was off center.  It was lined up at the bottom and then headed off to the left as it went up to the top.  The finish was rubbed off where the door met the door frame at the top center.  It seems the item is not that well made and during shipping the door shifts to the left and remains there permanently.  There were also two or three small dings in the front frame of the door.  There was absolutely no damage to the packaging of any kind.  It was placed in the box this way.  For this price, I felt this was unacceptable and returned it for a replacement.  The replacement had the SAME EXACT problems.  I returned to also.  I think the manufacturer needs to look at some type of packaging change to stop the door from moving around during the shipping process.<br /><br />I then tried ordering from another retailer.  They had it for the same price but after opening an account with them, I got another 20% off.  It arrived and had the same door problem, only much less so.  Since there were no dings in the door frame, I decided to keep it.  After using it for a couple weeks, I can say that it is the best toaster oven I have ever owned.  It does everything right.  Since there are only two of us in the home, I think we will be using this in place of the regular oven as it cooks so evenly.<br /><br />As some of the reviews stated, it is a power hungry kitchen appliance.  When it is running with the convection on, the light in the refrigerator has a slight flicker to it when you open the door.  It should have its own dedicated power line.  I think I am going to move it to the other side of the kitchen where it will share power with the dishwasher and disposer.  I do not think either of those will be running at the same time as the toaster oven.

Kieth Hensel did a bang-up job of designing this kitchen  machine!  I love that its facade measures almost a perfect Golden Mean ratio, and I hope that was planned.  When the door is fully-open, its level with the counter top.  The magnetic rack pull-out is a super feature, as is the convection cooking!  The pull-out bottom tray is a breeze to clean.  So far for me this is the ultimate table-top oven!  I've owned two lesser ovens previously and there's just no comparison to this one.  The only suggestion I would have is that Breville put a small light bulb in the top of it.  I mentioned having purchased this oven to a friend, and he went right out and bought one also!

We've been very happy so far.  The only draw backs I have found is that the cooking sheets slide too easily on the metal rack and have caused me to almost drop a hot pie all over myself and the floor.  Also, there is little room between the back of your hand and the very hot oven door when you reach in to pull the rack out which has resulted in a couple of burns.  I've since purchased an \\""ove glove\\"" which has solved that problem though.  Another drawback that drives my husband crazy is there is no oven light and it can be difficult to see whether an item has browned sufficiently w/out opening the door and sliding the item out slightly.

The first was a Proctor Silex I got while in the service so it's over 30 years old, still works, thou I wouldn't use it for food as both it and my regular range have heavy oil smell from using them too many times to temper tool steel after an oil quench.<br />Second one was a Black and Decker, worked fine for 6 years and thermostat now sticks on, so it has just two states off or on.<br /><br />Many comments on how wonderful life was because this heated food evenly, Huh?<br />I never noticed this to be a problem with anything other than the early microwaves that didn't have turn tables, I guess I'm just an insensitive cad.<br /><br />Another compared it to Apple products,, right on if he meant they charge a huge premium  for a slightly better design and quality that should have only cost them pennies. There is one big difference thou, Computers and phones are obsolete in two years or less and I'm expecting this to last decades. A few dollars a year vs a few hundred. I expected as much before I bought it, I know the price is higher than it should be but I don't regret it because it's many years of having a nice thing.<br /> I'M not rich enough else stupid enough for the Apple.<br /><br />It is a much nicer build than any toaster oven I've had (two) or any I've seen in the stores (many)<br /><br />Be careful what you wish for: I use old magazines under the food while eating to keep it from cooling too fast, the magazine having been warmed on top of the oven while the food cooks. The top of this gets nowhere near as hot as the old B&D so I need to figure out some other way to keep things warm. I thought an enclosure that got hot was a bad thing and it turns out I miss it. (it gets very warm but slower and less than the B&D)<br /><br />Cooking times are at most 1 or 2 minutes faster than on the non convection B&D (13 minutes vs 14 for frozen nuggets eg.)

I just want to add that the oven still works great.  Because there are just the two of us, we use it for 80% of our oven cooking.  Meets are so tender when slow roasted on convection.  If anything ever happens to this oven, I will immediately get another one.  I still frequently use the top as a warming tray and also keep a thick dish drying mat on top and that is where our plasticware dries after coming out of the dishwasher.  You will not be disappointed in your purchase!<br /><br />Previous review (no changes):<br />My Hamilton Beach convection oven's convection fan \\""died\\"" after using three years.  Everything else worked great and I liked that I seldom had to use my big oven because it was large - many of the countertop ovens are typical toaster ovens that are too small.  But I missed the convection feauture - especially for cooking meat so I donated it when I moved from Texas back to Virginia this summer.  It is just my husband and me now most of the time and we work opposite shifts so are often only cooking for ourselves so I did a lot of research on tabletop convection ovens.<br /><br />The Breveille had such good reviews that I bought it.  It is not as large as my Hamilton Beach - but larger than many of the toaster type ovens on the market.  I wanted it in black but it only comes in brushed stainless steel - but it looks - and cooks - like a commercial oven.  I love it.  I have made bran muffins in it every morning for the two weeks I have had it - perfect muffins every time.<br /><br />My husband did not want me to get another tabletop oven because counter space is prime real estate in our smaller kitchen but I just could not see heating the big oven up to cook muffins for 20 minutes, etc.  So, he kind of groaned when he saw it on the counter a few weeks ago.  It took me a few times of experimenting - and then actually reading the manual - to get the dials set right but I like that they are turn dials and not electronic because they should last longer. One thing when I first heated t as instructed before using was the current temperature - it looked like it had two readings.  Finally - duh- I realized I needed to peel off the protective sticker,,,,,<br /><br />Well, my husband offered to bring in a turkey breast for their potluck today at his work.  At Wal-Mart I picked him up the Honeysuckle White turkey breasts - figuring that since Honeysuckle White has always been the best tasting turkeys we have roasted that camd from the grocery store - I couldn't go wrong.  He was a little more astute than I was at first and figured out the controls himself (men don't read instruction manuals anyway).  He used the convection feature for roasting the turkey breast.  He put it in the fridge last night and put it back in the fridge after his commute. He set it out 30 minutes before the potluck and used my electric knife to carve it.  He said he is glad he tasted it before putting it out or he would not have gotten any.  He said it was absolutely delicious - the convection really ikept in the juices well - and even though thoroughly done on the meat thermometer - tender and juicy on the inside.  He called me from work and told me to go back to Wal-mart and get a few more of them and put in the freezer because the Honeysuckle White are hard to find at other times of the year and he definitly wants more to cook in the Breville.<br /><br />I know this oven will come in handy over the holidays when my house is full of children and grandchildren.  You can use the top of the Breville as a warming tray!  Plus there is a warm setting on the dial fo foods inside.  The Breville will hold a 13 x 9 pan provided the pan does not have protruding edges.<br /><br />The Breville is  more expensive that I would have liked - but it looks like it was built to last and we are now BOTH thrilled with it.  I have used it every day for two weeks.

This oven does bake very, very evenly.  I haven't had to rotate a pan to keep everything baking evenly which is a hallmark of a well done counter top oven.  The biscuits came out very even for example.  The control panel is very friendly and intuitive.  Their default settings actually work very well.  The oven even offers default settings for fresh or frozen pizza and you can 'dial' in the size of the pizza too!  The toast function works well.  You can set the darkness level and the number of slices you are toasting.  A single slice of toast was done very evenly.  The ability to do a 13 inch pizza is great.  The ability to use a standard 9 x 13 pan (no handles) is also great.  It beeps when the chosen temperature has been reached.  It beeps when the timed bake is over.  It does retain the last settings used but unplugging it for a few minutes will reset it to factory defaults.  There is a button to turn the convection fan off if you wish.  There is no oven light as a side note.  It is a very nice looking unit which may matter to you since it sits out on the counter at all times.  I read many reviews and would like to clarify that my user guide stated in several places that oven proof glass and ceramic is fine to use (example on page 25).  It only cautioned against not using oven proof glass or ceramic.  Also my user guide stated that you can cover a dish with aluminum foil but do not allow it to touch the sides of the oven.  Also, be sure to securely cover the dish or the fan can cause it to move if not (example on page 25).  The exterior of this oven, like almost all counter top ovens, does get hot.  I am a big fan of counter top ovens for the cost savings alone.  I have convinced co-workers to try them and they have reported a decrease in their electricity bill from making just this change.  The wall oven or free-standing range oven uses 3500 watts.  This oven is a great 'big oven' replacement.  I sure hope it lasts a long time (since so many things manufactured today aren't built to last).convinced co-workers to try them and they have reported a decrease in their electricity bill from making just this change.

Not enough to be a deal breaker, but really, to have to fiddle the dial SEVERAL times before it starts responding is a pretty big oversight imo, and very much a pain.<br />*******<br /><br />After replacing several toaster ovens, (each time buying a more expensive model to try and compensate for potential manufacturing crappiness), and the last one that died after 2 years was a $145 Krups, which is STILL highly recommended by reviewers, I decided to go full bore and get the Cadillac, if you will, of toaster ovens.<br /><br />I read soooo many reviews, trying to find something that would last more than a couple of years (at most), I read reviews of toaster oven reviews, I read individual reviews.  I feel like the Toaster Review Sensei now.  If someone started shooting toaster model numbers at me, I could probably immediately tell you something about it  \\""CRAP!\\""  \\""TOASTS GREAT, CONVECTION FAN TOO LOUD\\"", \\""PERFECT, UNTIL IT EXPLODES GLASS ALL OVER YOUR KITCHEN (not kidding, there is a model out there with MULTIPLE complaints about the glass EXPLODING!)<br /><br />So I narrowed it down to the top Cuisinart models based on tons of reading and researching, and ironically, the Krups model that had just died on me.  I sure was not going to buy another Krups, and the Cuisinart reviews, while good, left me cold about a few things:<br /><br />1. the \\""knuckle burning\\"" thing...kept coming up in multiple reviews.  Over and over I read about people singeing their knuckles.  What's up with that?!  OK, so maybe some people have fat fingers, I was not going to dismiss it on that alone.<br /><br />2. \\""Crumb tray removes from the back only\\""  Whoa...now we are getting into a level of inconvenience that I don't want when paying more than $100 for a toaster oven.  Still, not a deal breaker, considering nothing else had even close to the same amount of good reviews.<br /><br />3. \\""Toasts just \\""ok\\"", but bakes well and cooks well.\\""  Unfortunately I use my toaster oven 80% for toast and 20% for other stuff (pizza, frozen foods, etc).  Slow, and/or \\""just ok\\"" toasting is not acceptable (again, all this according to the probably hundred reviews I read)<br /><br />4.  Final straw was that the unit \\""does not turn off after the cooking/baking/toasting cycle is finished\\"".  WHAT. THE. &^#$&^?!  You have to be kidding me.  NEXT!  :)  $20 Kmart jobs do this. Yet a top of the line Cuisinart does not?  Unacceptable.<br /><br />Don't even remember how I stumbled across this Breville because it's not really mentioned in a lot of reviews, but I am glad I bought it.  Yes, very VERY pricey for a toaster oven imo (lost one star because of this), but I have none of the issues above that were complained about with the Cuisinarts, and I now RELISH making and eating toast in the morning.<br /><br />Not sure why there don't seem to be more, *better*, toaster ovens on the market...but it is HARD to find one apparently, that is not junk.<br /><br />We shall see how the durability is on this one...will post an update a year from now.<br /><br />I will say this...I certainly didn't expect this unit to toast any better than my Krups, but the difference was immediately noticeable by all family members.  I THINK it's because it's crunchier on the outside, yet still moist in the middle, something that was not as well done by the Krups.<br /><br />Frozen pizzas come out great (also better than the Krups), and have not tried anything else yet.  I love the look, I love the feel of a QUALITY built unit, and I love the performance so far.  Has exceeded my already high expectations. If they would just cut $50 off (shop around *cough*), it would get 5 stars from me.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Only nit I will pick is that the dials are not very responsive when you first turn them.  You have to turn them a certain distance before they \\""kick in\\"" and change the values.

It seemed like a better choice than a toaster since a toaster-oven does a lot more. I use it almost daily for baking potatoes. Convection cooks evenly and cuts the cooking time considerably. To speed things up, I'd microwave half-way, then put the food in the Breville for the last 5-10 minutes to get the right texture and browning. I haven't used the regular oven at all since I purchased this, it also preheats in 1/3 of the time. It's great for baking cookies, reheating pizza and left-overs, broiling frozen patties, etc. The interface is very simple; I was able to figure it out without reading the manual. They do recommend running the unit empty before using it for the first time. It shuts off automatically once it's finished cooking, and keeps the previous setting until the next time.

Not Good!,"Please note last update at the end of this write-up.<br /><br />Let me start off that I love this oven.  The features and its ability to toast bagels to bread perfectly and all the other modes of operation are better than any other oven out there.  The reason for the one star rating after 2 months of use is that the unit scared me to the point of returning for a refund.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if a recall is triggered.<br /><br />This morning, after 2 months of working perfect, I toasted a bagel.  After the tone went off I removed my bagel and walked away from the unit, and I turned off the overhead kitchen light.  When I came back in the room with the lights off in the room I noticed an orange glow from the Smart Oven.  Keep in mind that the front control panel was dark and the ON button was also dark (it has a red ring around the button when on) but the upper heating elements were ON!!!  The unit was extremely hot on the outside.  I unplugged it from the wall and left it that way for a number of minutes.  When I plugged it back in the elements came back on as soon as it was plugged in.<br /><br />Ok, I have a defective unit.  But knowing this and that the unit can stick in the on position with the control panel showing it is turned off doesn't leave me with a warm fussy feeling that a replacement wouldn't do the same thing.  WHERE ARE THE SAFETYS?  It seems to me there should be some type of over temp protection, like a thermo fuse or similar device.  At minimum there should be a main switch that keep any power from getting to the heating elements.<br /><br />I have sent an email to Breville about this and am waiting to hear back.  If you have experienced a similar experience please leave a comment about it on this review.<br /><br />Regards!!<br /><br />Nov. 2, 2009  UPDATE<br />Update:<br /><br />I did not return my unit.  The engineer in me wanted to understand the problem and to better identify the condition to relay to the manufacture.<br /><br />The evening after the above write up I plugged the unit back into the power outlet.

When we first unpacked the oven, we were awed by how well was packaged and what a beautiful piece of equipment this was.  It is a very well made piece.  My first few ventures -- roasted chicken and toast -- were not so great.  Like anything -- no matter how simple -- there is a learning process.  Short period of learning, but still learning.  It didn't take long.  Now, I make absolutely perfect roast chicken and I don't think I ever had more perfect toast -- crisp on outside, soft on inside.  For the six months since we've had this oven, my husband and I have never used our full oven.  I bake all my bread in it.  All my casseroles go in this oven.

Unfortunately the top of this oven is just too low.  I can't fit the La Cloche.  There are also several other items that I would like to use this for but again there is just not enough headroom in the oven.  I had a Hamilton Beach oven with rotisserie and it had plenty of room for these items.  It was not quite as nice in use as the Breville nor was it quite as capable but at least it had the room I needed to bake what I wanted.  I have had to break it out of storage when I bake bread these days.  Considering the Hamilton Beach only cost about 40% of what the Breville cost I wish I had not bothered at this point.  The Breville does most of what I want but when push comes to shove it is just lacking in that one area.  About 2-3 inches in height inside would fix it completely and the oven would not be appreciable larger than it already is.

It's great!  It's big, it does what Breville says it does, it looks good, and it's well made.  It's really more of a small oven than a toaster oven.  Of course, you can still make toast in it, but if that's what you want it for than I would recommend buying a toaster.  Using this to make two slices of toast is like using a Hummer to drive your self to work.  I've actually used it to successfully bake two frozen entrees that warned not to use a toaster oven (though do so at your own risk).  One was a pot pie in an \\""ovenable\\"" paper pie form, and the other was veggie patties in an \\""ovenable\\"" plastic container sealed with thin plastic film.  Both items cooked perfectly and neither burst into flames or melted.  The convection really does allow you to lower the temperature, also.<br /><br />For other aesthetically focused product designers like myself ... yes, the control knobs feel cheap (I'm guessing plated plastic), and yes, the standoffs that attach the stainless handle to the stainless door are grey metallic plastic ... but everything else is real, and from five feet away it looks commercial grade.  Besides, have you looked at your other choices?<br /><br />Why do toaster ovens have no insulation?  They would be so much more efficient!

I've burned out a bunch of them!  The last two I've owned were Black & Decker ovens large enough to hold a 9\\"" x 13\\"" baking pan.  Has anyone out there tried finding a new model that'll do that?  I don't care about pizzas, for heaven's sake, I want to actually bake in one.<br /><br />My last B & D finally died and I looked around, as I do every 5 years or so, and saw a lot of silly toaster ovens with a bump in the back for yet more pizza.  Somehow, I came across this oven on Amazon.  I didn't know Breville even sold toaster ovens here in the States!  I have one of their excellent juicers, a really nice design.<br /><br />This toaster oven is so far from the little $30-40 discount store ovens that they shouldn't even share the name. There are three heating elements on the inside top of the oven and three on the bottom.  Depending on the program chosen in the LCD panel, these elements will be controlled individually.  Additionally, there are three different rack levels to match the various programs; these are considerately labeled on the front glass.<br /><br />To use, one chooses one of the programs, e.g. bake, roast, broil, toast, pizza, etc.  Then, within the program chosen one may make individual adjustments for temperature, time, frozen preprep and convection.  This is more flexible than my full-size oven!  I like my bacon broiled and the broil position is so close to the top elements that the bacon ends curled and burned on the elements.  I like broiling steaks and hamburgers and quickly learned to use the middle rack setting rather than the top.  I like baking fresh cornbread in an 8\\"" x 8\\"" Pyrex dish; it is done to perfection here.  There is a constant monitoring of oven temperature with various elements heating up and cooling to maintain accuracy.  I've never had a toaster oven that can do this.  This variability in oven temp is the reason they tend to fall down on risen baked items.<br /><br />Yes, this oven is quite expensive. However, again, don't equate this with some upscale yuppie designer version of a cheapie oven, as Cuisinart in particular has tried to do.  This oven is heavy but it's also heavy-duty.  As usual, Breville provides a thick and useful owner's manual, with detailed explanations of the various programs and options.  The oven comes with a black enamel broiler rack and pan and a round pizza pan.  The broiler pan is the kind with an undulating surface and holes in the troughs.  I prefer my old wire 9 x 13 wire broiling rack and much deeper pan from the B & D and have kept it to use for broiling.  Also, Breville recommends not washing the broiling or baking pan in the dishwasher.  My B & D chrome rack and aluminum pan goes perfectly through.  I don't like those mostly-solid broiling racks; they tend to hold too much grease from meats still on the surface.  A wire broiling rack allows all the grease to drain down. Optional is a pizza stone for those real fanatics along with a perforated pizza crisper pan, and a matching cutting board presumably to be set on the top of the oven.<br /><br />Drawbacks?  Unlike my last two B & D ovens, this one gets hot on the outside, hot enough that supposedly one can use the top surface as a keep-warm surface.  I'd prefer they insulate the oven better.  The rack, when in the middle position, is pulled out by the opening door with magnets in the door.  Be careful!  Pulling the door out a little too vigorously means the pan and rack fly out and onto either the cook or the floor.<br /><br />This oven can truly be considered a smaller substitute to a full-sized oven, moreso than any other toaster oven I've owned.

So here is my review on the Breville Smart oven.<br />  The first thing I will mention, on pass reviews some people say the directions say not to use tin foil or glass....Obviously these people can't read or don't understand. The book states clearly use only oven proof glass. That's the glass you buy for use in your oven. No one I Know of ever put a glass of water or coffee in a convection or toaster oven for that matter.<br />  The second thing is the tin foil. It is perfectly fine to put tin foil on top of any pan or OVEN proof glass in this oven. The direction just say please don't rap the tin foil around the heating element.<br />  The third thing is I have used both with no problems what so ever.<br /><br />  The 4th Thing is read the positive reviews of this Breville oven.  This is the best Convection oven out there.<br />Do you know how I know that? Because when you click the button on you can hear the convection..<br />  I'm not a member of the grape vine thing, just a straight shooter and no one paid me for this review.<br />  The Truth..",2009-09-13

After reading many more reviews & peaking into boxes of two flimsy countertop ovens before returning same, we decided to give the Breville a chance. Contruction inside & out is high-end & well finished. So are the accessories provided. The size is impressive but not overwhelming.<br /><br />So far, we're happy enough with the performance. It toasts beautifully & with a downward tweak on temperature to compensate for the convection feature, baking biscuits, bread, & pizza has gone pretty well. The range of warming & reheating temperatures is great also. So what about the warnings not to use tin foil? Why not? As it turns out, the manual includes sidebars in most of the sections which read as follows:<br /><br />\\""NOTE: When using metal foil to cover accessories, pans and dishes, it is recommended that the wire rack be in the middle or bottom location.\\"" and \\""Be sure that the metal foil is fitted securely as close contact with the oven's heating elements can cause overheating and risk of fire.\\""<br /><br />Likewise, there are warnings, NOT prohibitions, regarding the use of glass:<br /><br />\\""NOTE: Caution should be exercised when using pans and dishes constructed of materials other than metal. If using ceramic or glass pans or dishes it is important that they are oven safe to prevent cracking.\\""<br /><br />These are the very same precautions I've exercised while using both gas & electric ovens for 30+ years! I'll try out foil & glass ASAP & amend this review if there's a problem.<br /><br />Finally, I do have two relatively minor criticisms. Firstly, only one rack was supplied with the oven, although there are three rack positions. For the Breville's hefty price tag, providing a second rack wouldn't have taken that big a chunk from their profit. (It cost us another $15 to order a second one from the company & although their double-phone-call process is involved while they're retooling their web site, at least S&H is free.) Secondly, the oven takes a reasonably long time to preheat, at least 10 minutes more than the large oven in our electric range, depending on desired temp. Still, the convenience of having a second oven makes that merely inconvenient. I'm learning to turn on the Breville first!hey're retooling their web site, at least S&H is free.)

The one the manufacturer sent to replace the bad one is working now.  Overall, it feels cheap.  The knobs don't have really definite stops on them, especially the main function selector.  The unit radiates heat from all sides, and that's bad for things around it.  My Krups (that I'm replacing with this one because of the larger cavity size on the Breville) was only warm to the touch on the sides and back.  Also, the Breville's baking pan and pizza pan are really thin and cheap!  Both bend from the heat such that you can't use them.  They're basically throwaway accessories that I'd have expected to be better with a $250 oven.<br /><br />Overall, it's worth about $150, but not what I paid.  Keep looking.

I love the size and the streamlined look, and it works great for baking and toasting.  I have made halibut, shrimp, toast and bagels, reheated and all have been perfect.  I love the knobs because they lightly click in increments of degrees, or for the number of pieces of toast and from light to dark, etc.  I know that it was not cheap, but honestly, the Jennair that I returned twice was $550.00 and the Sanyo was $150.00, and I had such a hassle with both of them, I just wanted piece of mind.  I got this one on a promotion from Amazon at $249.00 complete out the door ( free shipping, no tax), and it is worth every penny because it does what it says, and I don't cringe every time I try to cook something.  It comes with pans that fit nicely, and by the way, I did line the pan with foil under the fish, and had no problems at all.  I was using bake one time and convection bake another, so I am not sure about trying it with broil.  The screen is well lit and organized, and goes to energy saver mode after a few minutes.  it lights up again right away if you turn any knob.  It is larger than my old toaster oven, but it needs to be to cook all of the things that it is capable of.  It is not huge, but to give you an idea of the size, it can fit six pieces of toast on one rack.  By the way, they don't recommend cooking meat over about 4 pounds at a time.  I want to thank everybody who have posted other reviews.  Because of you, I knew exactly what to expect, and even though nothing bothers me about this oven, I knew what everybody else had to say about it, so there were no surprises.this oven, I knew what everybody else had to say about it, so there were no surprises.",2009-06-19

However, we are a family that uses toaster ovens daily and wanted to get the best of the best.  I think we found it!  First of all it looks great! I agree with other reviews that said the buttons could be a bit more substantial feeling...but, they work great and maybe design-wise, there is a reason the buttons aren't heavier feeling. Also, I think an interior light would be wonderful.  Aside from that, however, I have to say that this thing has amazed me so far. I have made pizza, toast, bagels, casserols, baked potatoes and more with it and everything has come out great.  It is very user friendly and has many functions.  I hadn't realized how inferior my old toaster oven was until now.  I'm really glad it finally died, or I would never had invested in the Breville and I would never had known what a properly toasted bagel or a perfectly cooked pizza was like coming from a toaster oven.  I love the convection feature...it is quiet and cuts down on cooking time for many items. I love the easy to clean front crumb tray too. Oh yeah, there was one thing that bothered me and it's outer area around the window on both the inside and outside. Crumbs and such tend to get stuck in the little ridge where the glass goes into the metal and I worry that over time, that may build up and get ugly. I think if there was some kind of seal that could make that area smoother, that would be great...but again, maybe there is a reason why that can't be.  Not a big deal, but thought I'd mention it.  Over all, I am thrilled with my new toaster oven and I look forward to many years of use.  If you are on the fence about buying this item, I say to go for it, I dont think you'll be dissapointed and it is an investment that is worth while.  You will find yourself using it more than your oven and saving on time & energy!",2009-06-08

That way I could bake those large pizza's and large casseroles. The stainless body is easier to clean and holds up better than tin. And it doesnt change color due to long periods of exposure to high heat. The digital readout is really nice and easy to use. The oven heats up very quickly and has the ability to get extremely hot! The five quartz elements really make a difference. I knew going in that the only drawback might be the short power cord. It is indeed very short and has a funky wall plug. The plug has a ring built-in probably to ease pulling it out of the wall? I twist tied the cord to the side of the ring because it stuck out way too far. Other than the cord I'm truly enjoying this little oven. I've used it for a few months now and hope to enjoy it for years to come.,2009-05-27

It seems to do what it is supposed to do, and I would recommend it for a small kitchen or for one or two people who don't want to be firing up their big oven to do a small job.<br /><br />As far as likening it to an Apple computer, maybe so, but I saw no resemblence and who really cares about that sort of thing anyway. It was packed nicely but not any different from other products that I have bought recently. I saw no great improvement in the manuals or other paper that accompany the unit either, at least nothing to write home about. How does comparing it to a Mac computer improve its desireability? I would suspect that Breville would not particularly enjoy being labeled the Apple computer of the toaster ovens, since this is a foreign company, since the oven is foreign made, and since Apple computers are utilized even less outside the USA than inside the USA where Mac's are a long, long ways from being in first place. However, Breville might surely be delighted if it were compared to a PC, but it is an oven, I think, not a 'puter.<br /><br />Anyway, I am glad I purchased it even though I was certainly initially turned off by the silly Apple comparisons; so far it has done everything that I want it to do, but it is not a panacea as some of the Mac-heads want to say it is.",2009-05-17

In the broil position the rack is very close to the heat source so one must pay close attention during the broiling process. I sometimes broil in the center position.

Toasted breads are just a bit of a disappointment as slices tend to toast unevenly. It offers many control features which allow for a lot of flexibility.

I do have some that I feel are equal to it (my KitchenAid stand mixer, my Breville one-cup coffee brewer, and my Zojirushi bread machine) but I don't think any surpass this quality oven.  I believe that when I make the decision to purchase a small appliance, I should buy  the one I feel to be the best so I don't regret it later on.  So, yes, I have spent more money than I had to but, at the same time, I have been not been disappointed with these outstanding appliances.<br /><br />So far, everything I have made with this toaster/convection oven has turned out perfectly.  I find it hard to think of this as a toaster oven, as it is so much more.  I know I can prepare family size roasts in it with no problem.  The function settings are Toast, Bagel, Bake, Roast, Broil, Pizza, Cookies, Reheat, and Warm. I don't think it's possible that there is even one that I won't use.  I have had this wonderful oven for only 4 days and I have used Toast and Bake several times and Broil, Pizza, Cookies and Warm at least once.<br /><br />I really appreciate the fact that the timer can be set up to 2 hours (some toaster ovens can be set for only 30 minutes) and that at the end of the timed cycle, it automatically shuts off.  I know that I can sometimes become very distracted when preparing dinner and could easily forget to shut the oven off as soon as I should.<br /><br />As far as not being able to use aluminum foil and glass pans, I contacted the company and they said both were allowable with some precautions.  Aluminum foil must never touch the quartz heating elements plus using too much foil in the oven can cause overheating and glass pans must not be used if you plan on cooking with unusually high temperatures, such as when broiling.  I plan on being very careful with both but I don't view this as a problem.  As far as I know, these are actually restrictions on most or all toaster ovens due to the smaller size and higher heat concentrations, but rarely mentioned.<br /><br />The controls are intuitive and I think, in most cases, this oven can be used without referring to the manual.  It is really a \\""no-brainer\\"".  I have read other reviewers mentioning that the knobs are not as substantial as they would like but to me, this is not an issue.  I really don't know how weighty they are (or aren't) but they function well and look good, so that's really all I care about.<br /><br />This oven is easy to clean, especially since you can use spray cleaners.  You have to spray your cleaning cloth or sponge and not spray directly into the oven but that works just fine.  I love the fact that the crumb tray, which conveniently pulls out from the front of the oven, is the entire bottom of the oven.<br /><br />The electrical plug, of all things, is also a bonus!  It has a large hole in the middle in which to insert your finger to help remove it from the outlet.  This seems minor but is much better than having to \\""wiggle\\"" a tight-fitting 3-prong grounded plug to remove it from the wall.  This is really attention to detail!  The cord is short (for safety reasons) but works fine for me.  However, if your outlet is not conveniently located, I have found in the hardware store extension cords that have 3-prong grounded outlets and are rated for major appliances.<br /><br />The one minor problem I had was when I broiled some steaks, the kitchen filled with smoke.  But I'm sure that was my error and the next time, I will put the rack one notch further from the heating elements.  It probably would have been okay if they were 1\\"" thick or less but these were rather thick steaks and barely fit under the elements.  But, despite the smoke, the steaks were juicy and delicious and the oven was an easy clean-up.<br /><br />The ONLY complaint I can think of (and this is REALLY minor) is that there is no interior light.  I was aware of this when I purchased it and Inow keep a small flashlight alongside of the oven.  This isn't really necessary but I love to be able to take a peek at what I'm cooking.<br /><br />I made a frozen pizza and my husband actually LOVED it (he usually HATES frozen pizza) since it came out tender and crispy, yet the cheese was not burned.<br /><br />I made toast and it was evenly browned on both sides (with, of course, unavoidable grid marks on the bottom) with a wonderful crispy texture and great taste.<br /><br />I also made baked potatoes which were plump and beautifully cooked on the inside with a nice crisp skin on the outside, unlike some I have prepared in my regular oven that became shrunken and hard.<br /><br />I also made a frozen dinner (not a great accomplishment, I know) but I used the convection feature and lowered the recommended temperature by 25 degrees and did not bake it any longer than instructed and it came out fully cooked with the gravy for the Salisbury steak bubbling.  So the convection feature really does work--and very nicely, I would say--it is so quiet!<br /><br />And the last thing I made was a batch of cookies.  They were super large and I upped the preset time by two minutes and they came out PERFECT!<br /><br />In conclusion, I am very happy with this purchase and if I had it to do over, I would buy it again without hesitation.  This was very well thought out, both technically and cosmetically, and is sure to be an asset to any kitchen.  So don't hesitate, GET IT!!!<br /><br />Update 11/4/09--I am still lovin' this oven!  Seriously, I find I use it much more than I thought I would, as it is so-o-o convenient.  Besides functioning perfectly, it is at countertop level, which I find very helpful.  If something needs to go in an oven, the only thing that makes me use my full size oven is if the item doesn't fit in this one.  But most everything fits and cooks to perfection.  If something happened to this one, I have become so dependent on it that I would buy another one without hesitation!

Right out of the box I was impressed at how beautifully built it was and how nice it looked on the counter. The controls are straightforward; the blue backlight is pleasing to the eye.<br /><br />So far, I have baked cakes, Italian bread, cupcakes, brownies, cookies, quiche, fish, roasted chicken breasts, pasta and banana breads (it can fit two loaf pans at once), reheated a multitude of foods all with perfect results.

I do not find the oven to be overly hot to the touch as another reviewer mentioned. It is after all an oven and should be expected to get hot.

They seem to post predominantly positive reviews on all the free items they get -- not really an objective opinion.  That being said, this oven is pretty darn good.  It is really a good size -- larger than your traditional toaster oven, but not a complete counter-hog either.  The unit blends in well with any kitchen that has modern stainless steel appliances.  The design is exceptionally complementary to the Bosch and Thermador appliance lines.<br /><br />Good points:<br />1. Intuitive, easy to use controls (dials)<br />2. Turns off after cook time is finished.<br />3. Even heating<br />4. If you use one setting often (for me it is the one to cook french-fries for my son), the oven will stay on that setting and all you have to do is press one button to get it started.  It's also extremely easy to change the setting.<br />5. Convection bake setting is much faster than traditional bake setting (but by the time you wait for it to preheat first, I am not sure you save any time).<br />6.

Brushed stainless steel with blue LCD control panel gives a high-end, commercial-grade appearance<br />-Sturdy construction<br />-Innovative controls and pre-programmed cycles make common cooking tasks quick and easy, while still providing for complete customization<br />-Even and consistent results for all cooking functions<br />-Uniquely shaped plug with finger loop is easy to remove from outlet<br />-Bumpers on back maintain safe distance from wall<br />-High quality accessories, including baking, broiling and pizza pans<br />-Magnetic door frame pulls out rack when door is opened, making for easy access<br />-Full size crumb tray is easy to remove and clean<br />-Top surface doubles as warming tray<br /><br />Thumbs down for:<br /><br />-No interior light<br />-Knobs feel a little light and loose, inconsistent with the commercial-grade appearance of the oven<br />-Spring-loaded door will slam shut if not fully opened, increasing the risk of burns when the oven is hot<br /><br />Overall, I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a better countertop oven. Toasting was even and consistent, and customization controls make it possible to fine tune the degree of brownness just to your liking. As for baking, I tried the Lemon Cheesecake recipe from the instruction manual, and I think it was one of the best I've made.

Inside the oven, in the back center, the oven has a recessed area in the center rack position, that was designed to hold the 13\\"" included pizza pan.  Preheating this oven takes minutes.  Toast takes longer than a toaster (a small price to pay for the convenience and ease of use).  Some reviews mentioned it was pricey.  I disagree whole heartedly.  This oven is a value when you consider its many uses.  Baking is a breeze and the temperature can be adjusted in some settings by 5-10 degrees.

It's worked perfectly, makes gorgeous bagels, and we think it's about all we'll need.

Customer support was very nice and there was no problem getting a replacement.

Moreover, we cook a lot and entertain a good-sized group of people once a month - one oven just doesn't get it done and even two can can leave dishes jockeying for oven time.<br /><br />In this case, the Breville had to square off against a direct competitor, [[ASIN:B000063XG3 Cuisinart TOB-175BC Convection Toaster Oven/Broiler, Brushed Chrome]].  With two extremely competent ovens from reputable manufacturers, victory lay in the attention to small details.  The Cuisinart has served as well for several years, handily taking care of small casseroles, breads and so forth and we figured it would be tough to beat.<br /><br />The Breville did just that. It matched (or slightly exceeded) the Cuisinart's temperature controls and cook functions with only very slight drawbacks.  Where it won the day though was the increased size (allowing us to cook slightly larger dishes) and in some small details.  The Breville has more broil functions (and more functions total), allowing better control of what elements are being used and at what level.  The front access crumb tray (as opposed to rear for the Cuisinart) is a joy for ease of cleaning - no more pulling it away from the wall to get to the tray.  Also, the tray is full coverage - there is not a piece of the oven or door opening that the tray won't catch - crumbs can't get lost in the machine.  The Cuisinart's design has an area at the front of the oven where the door is that is impossible to get clean and drives my wife nuts.  We use our oven at least twice a day if not more - so being able to easily clean it and having a little extra space really won the day.<br /><br />A few caveats: the oven gets really, really hot on the exterior - I would surmise that trying to maximize the cooking space has caused Breville to limit the insulation that retains heat (the Cuisinart gets pretty hot too, but not this hot) - in the making lemons out of lemonade category, Breville says you can use the top of the oven as a plate warmer; the oven feels very solid, but the dials are kind of plasticky without firm, defined clicks; heating in a good-sized oven like this can be uneven (Breville admits as much in its manual), but convection settings make it an easy fix; the maximum cook time is 2 hours (I have no idea why you would limit the low and slow option).<br /><br />Overall it is a great oven and extremely capable if you have the counter space for it.  We are making space for it.  The only question is whether we have use for -three- ovens in the workspace or should store the Cuisinart and pull it out when it gets busy.of lemonade category, Breville says you can use the top of the oven as a plate warmer; the oven feels very solid, but the dials are kind of plasticky without firm, defined clicks; heating in a good-sized oven like this can be uneven (Breville admits as much in its manual), but convection settings make it an easy fix; the maximum cook time is 2 hours (I have no idea why you would limit the low and slow option).

Rather than accept the standard limitations and flaws of compact ovens, Breville has re-thought the oven to address safety, convenience and function.<br /><br />Among my favorite features:<br />- The oven's programs for different foods are a great way to enhance the cooking of the food, as well as save energy.<br />- There are five heating elements; the power sent to the elements is adjusted up or down, or turned off altogether, depending on what's right for the food being cooked.  You can also use convection to circulate heat.<br />- The oven comes with a 12\\"" x 12\\"" enamel baking pan, a 12\\"" x 12\\"" enamel broil rack, and a 13\\"" non-stick pizza pan. Including appropriately-sized pans is a big plus.  Having pans designed for the oven is a time saver (no messing around) and helps get the most out of the oven.<br />- And you have to love the \\""Magnetic Auto-Eject Rack\\"" - think about how many times you've burned yourself pulling out the rack - although unfortunately it only works when the rack is at the middle rack height position.<br /><br />The oven is very carefully packed for shipping, with Breville using an outer shipping box around the standard inner box you'd see in a store.  That's a big plus on an item like this, as Amazon doesn't pack well for shipping most of the time.<br /><br />The warranty is one year.<br /><br />Let's hope Breville offers this in black as well at some point; even though the silver is attractive, lots of people might prefer black.<br /><br />The Breville website has a lot of good info and pictures if you want more details - definitely take a look if you're considering a purchase.  The owners' manual is also available in PDF form at the Breville website if you want to better understand the oven, or see some of the 25 pages of recipes they suggest for this oven.  It may also help you understand the Breville approach - the manual is useful, clear, well done and attractive - no surprise!has a lot of good info and pictures if you want more details - definitely take a look if you're considering a purchase.

I wasted a day because I took the time to read the manual & it scares you by repeating on every page to NOT use foil. I already suffer from being a worry wart but decided this time to disregard the warnings & use my common sense. I would say...just don't cover the elements with foil. But who does that, anyway?<br />This oven is really wonderful. Tonight I used it to reheat the quiche I made last night (in the oven) & it reheated perfectly; unlike other times in other ovens, where it turns out to be a guessing game. An interior light would be perfect. That's the only down side for me.<br />As with other appliances I have purchased thru Amazon, the reviews are a great help & often enough, help make the sale. Thanks to all those who take the time to review.<br />I got this Breville Smart Oven for a Xmas present & am sold on it 100 percent. It IS a smart oven.<br />Five stars.<br /><br />January 21, 2010....Well, I've used my oven for a full year now & wish I could give it 10 stars! Just the reheat function alone would sell this for me. I have never before reheated a leftover dish that came out still moist when it should be or crisp when it should be. Wow!<br /><br />Actually, I do cook from scratch most of the time.

Using the large solid bar for the door handle gives it a modern look.  The dials are large and easy to read and figure out how to use.  The chrome is not overly shiny and doesn't have to be polished often to hide fingerprints.<br /><br />Opening the door reveals the solid build of the appliance.  The trays move in and out smoothly and lock into place well.  The oven comes with all the trays you'll need to get started but I ordered a 13\\"" pizza stone to go with it.  We anticipate cooking pizza in this oven at least once a week.<br /><br />It's always easier to just try out something new by ignoring the manual and pushing buttons and the Smart Oven is perfectly suited for this.  In fact, I haven't even ready the manual yet.  I put six pieces of homemade bread in the oven, turned a nob, pushed a button and cooked the bread for two minutes.  I pulled them out, flipped them over, buttered them, and repeated the process, ending with a perfect toast.<br /><br />Using the Smart Oven for Christmas cooking allowed us to both free up the wall unit for the turkey and to cook the twice-baked potatoes and pumpkin pie while the turkey was cooking.  The potatoes came out flawless but the pie was what clinched the deal.<br /><br />We got distracted after dinner and forgot the pie was cooking until four hours later.  But the timer had shut off and I pulled a perfectly baked pie out of the Smart Oven and served it warm to the crowd.<br /><br />I was so pleased with the quality and functionality of this appliance that I also ordered the Breville 1000-watt Die-Cast Hemisphere blender.<br />____________________________________________<br /><br />Still working great 4 years later.

The 'Out of Box Experience' is superb.  As another reviewer noted, the packaging is quite a bit like Apple's (see photos) - attractive graphics on an inner box protected in an outer, recyclable box.  The oven itself, when compared to the Cuisinart TOB-165 that we have been using (or even the stainless steel TOB-195 model), is like comparing an Apple Mac to a Dell:  visually more stylish and appealing, better engineered 'guts', and once operated, functionally very well thought out.<br /><br />A few years ago, our old toaster oven died and we migrated to the Cuisinart which, like this Breville BOV800XL, is a convection oven / toaster / broiler.  We liked it so much, that we gifted several more to friends and family.  Ah, if only this Breville had ben available then...<br /><br />The Breville is so vastly superior in every way - function, capacity, ease of use, and ease of cleaning.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />The timer on the Breville turns the oven off at the end of any kind of cycle as you would expect - toast, bagel, bake, broil, pizza, etc.This is hugely wonderful compared to the Cuisinart unit which only turns itself off after toasting - you have to remember to turn it off when in any other mode.  (The Cuisinart's timer is 'dumb' - just a beeper.)  Also, each Breville cycle has smart default settings, and can remember your own settings for temperature and time, or slices (toast) and darkness, etc.<br /><br />The BOV800XL accomodates a 13\\"" pizza pan (included).  We made two pizzas tonight  to test the oven, one fresh (deli) the other frozen.  I dialed the 'pizza' setting, dropped the default 450 temperature to 425, accepted convection mode, and accepted the default 12\\"" size for the fresh pizza and pressed the on button.  Once preheated, the oven beeped for the pizza to be inserted.  At the end of the timed cycle, the oven turned off and beeped again: perfect pizza!<br /><br />I then did a 9\\"" frozen Amy's pizza.  Similar procedure as above, but dialed the size knob down to 9\\"" and pressed the 'frozen food' button.  Again, perfect at the end of the cycle.<br /><br />Toast setting works great - up to 6 pieces of toast, as does the bagel setting, which toasts the top at a higher temp then the bottom to make the top crispy and the bottom warm but still soft.  Frozen waffles come out great - crunchy outside and moist inside, instead of all dried out.<br /><br />For baking, a 13\\"" x 9\\"" baking pan easily fits inside as does, of course, the larger pan that comes with the unit, loaf pans and small muffin pans.<br /><br />The glass door conveniently labels the three rack positions for broil, toast/cookie/bagel/pizza, and bake/roast/reheat/warm.<br /><br />The crystalline-looking heating elements (three on top, two on the bottom) seem to heat faster, and more evenly, than the metallic elements in other counter-top ovens.  Depending on the mode/cycle, the oven enables or disables certain elements, and changes the wattage of others.<br /><br />The crumb tray in the front answer another of my big complaints about the Cuininart.  No effort to pull the tray out at any time to brush off crumbs, or wash off accidental spills.  (The Cuinsart's crumb tray slides out of the rear of that unit, requiring minor gymnastics - enough to put it off until it is really gross.)<br /><br />The stainless finish and assembly is of high quality, and the oversized handle and control knobs give a feel of quality as well (and match current upper to high end major appliances).<br /><br />No doubt I'll have more comments after we use the Breville BOV800XL for a few months, but for now, I can only sing its praises.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Boring details:<br /><br />Dimension Comparison to Cuisinart TOB-165/195:<br /><br />The Breville being slightly larger permits it to be used for items that otherwise would have to go into a regular oven.  The interior of the Breville is 13 1/2\\"" x 11 1/2\\"" x 5\\"" high (to clear the elements), with a curved recess in the back so that a nearly 13\\"" pizza pan fits.  The Cuisinart is 11 1/2\\"" x 9 3/4\\"" x 5\\"" which cannot accommodate pizza, nor a 13 x 9 pan and toasts only 4 pieces of bread.<br /><br />The small increase in interior space which results in so much greater versatility is at the expense of only an inch of counter space required.  The Breville exterior is roughly 18 1/2\\"" wide x 16\\"" deep x 10 3/4\\"" high compared to the Cuisinart 17 1/2\\"" wide x 14\\"" deep x 10\\"" high.<br /><br />Electrical Notes:<br /><br />As others note, the oven uses a maximum of 1800 watts, which is basically all that a 15 amp circuit has to offer (most home kitchens will have either 15 or 20 amp circuits).  So, you shouldn't use other power hungry appliances on the same circuit as the BOV800XL.  As noted in the owner's manual, you must have a grounded 3-prong outlet, which any modern home will have.  Even though my kitchen is 20 years old, I'm fortunate that the electrician had included three circuits for appliances so no problems here.<br /><br />With regard to those concerned about the short cord:  do note that electrical codes require that outlets on kitchen counters be serviced by a minimum of two separate circuits and be no more than 2 feet from one another (4 feet at a corner).  Even under older codes that permit outlets up to 6' apart, the 3' cord is adequate.<br /><br />Installation note:<br /><br />This is a countertop oven.  When operating, nothing should be within 4\\"" of any side.  Because some people are accustomed to GE/Black and Decker toaster ovens that mount under cabinets, do note that that is NOT an option here because of the high heat and clearances required.  You really do need to have enough counter space to accommodate the unit.<br /><br />UPDATE November 2014:  the door spring broke today, so the door flops open.  That mine lasted almost 6 years of daily use is remarkable as I read many reports of other people's springs breaking after 3 or 4 years of use.  This is painful to repair...as so many screws have to be removed and contortions with the dangerously sharp metal case performed.  Steps can be found online.  Heading to a hardware store tomorrow to find a close match to the spring.  My old spring broke on BOTH ends.  Given that I got 6 years out of the oven, I won't reduce my 5 star review, although I feel that an item this expensive should be easier to repair.5\\"" high (to clear the elements), with a curved recess in the back so that a nearly 13\\"" pizza pan fits.

First, the package arrived today without a dent. It ships in a Breville box (be careful it you ship it as a surprise) inside another box. It is very well packed so there was no damage. Unboxing the oven reminded me of unpacking an Apple product. They really want you to feel that you have just purchased something great. The box is no ordinary convection oven box. But you don't buy an oven because of the box, right? I've posted a photo of what comes with the oven. You get a crumb tray, a wire rack, a two-piece broiler pan and a non-stick pizza pan. That's a good amount of extra stuff. Note that Breville recommends that the broiler pan not go in the dishwasher as it is enamel coated so it's going to take some elbow grease.<br /><br />This is my third convection oven, My first was a Black and Decker. It was terrible but I bought it before Al Gore invented the internet so there were no reviews to read. The second was a top-rated Cuisinart. The controls on the Cuisinart cracked, warped, toasted and ceased functioning after a year. So I was very excited to get an oven with sturdy knobs and a stainless steel front. Many reviewers have noted the magnetic wire rack device. It's not rocket science. They put two magnets in the door that grab the wire rack when it is in the middle slot. That's the only slot in which the magnets work. It is a nice feature.<br /><br />I baked a California Pizza Kitchen pizza. It turned out great. These pizzas, although delicious, are notoriously messy. They tend to drip grease and cheese. It did get a little smokey when the drippings hit the bottom elements. The design of the crumb tray catches all this junk for easy clean-up. You won't have to scrub junk off the bottom of the inside of the oven because the bottom pulls out and goes right into the sink.<br /><br />The next test was toast. Although it's best to use an actual toaster for toast, this oven did a much better job toasting bread than my other ovens, especially the Cuisinart. I started with two slices of sourdough placed in the center. I posted a photo showing you the results. Please note that I flipped over the piece on the right showing you the bottom. It actually turned out better than either of my previous ovens. However, it took over 5 minutes to get this result so it's not quick. But if you get upset waiting over five minutes for toast, then you have other problems.<br /><br />The top of the oven does get warm, which will come in handy as a food warmer. The handle is sturdy. I appreciate that it does not connect to the front glass.<br /><br />The electronic controls are very intuitive (like an iPhone) and easy to use. The computer sensor inside seems to work as advertised. This next point is minor but the electrical cord is rather short. The plug-in is a unique design that sticks out farther from the wall than most cords. This might be bad if you have limited counter space and the outlet you're using is directly behind the oven. It sticks straight out of the wall by about four inches. I'm not sure why they designed it that way but for some people this might be a frustration.<br /><br />What I cannot tell you is how this oven will perform over the months and years ahead. I am hoping that this oven will outperform the expensive Cuisinart. I'll revise this review this summer after we've used it for a while.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this oven. Breville seems to have done some great research on convection ovens. It will be interesting to see how Consumer Reports and the folks at America's Test Kitchen will rate this oven in the future.

Not only are they known for producing a high-quality product, but I've always appreciated the effort that they put forth into making an item using quality design elements as well.  Most all Breville products look great and this oven is no exception.  It has an industrial look to it that will fit in well with any decor, but it goes especially well with my modern, urban tastes.<br /><br />The materials used in its construction appear to be top-notch.  This Breville oven seems to be built like a tank and it exudes quality.  It is heavy, substantial and solid.  One gets the impression that it will last a very long time.<br /><br />When I first read about the product, I frankly thought that the price seemed to be a bit high for a \\""toaster oven\\"".  Now that I've used it, I can sincerely say that the price is most reasonable for a product of this quality.  In fact, my girlfriend, who already owns a Breville blender, liked my oven so much that she is going to buy one for herself.<br /><br />While the controls are fairly intuitive, you do need to pay a bit of attention to things.  For example, you cannot simply cook a pizza by dialing in its size and walking away.  I cooked a 12\\"" thin crust pizza that was frozen and the default cooking time was 22 minutes.  That would have been way too long for this particular pizza.  Perhaps it would have been the proper setting for a pizza with a thicker crust, but not for a thin crust pizza.  So again, pay attention.<br /><br />The cooking is really quite fast using the convection feature.  I can cook a quesadilla in a few minutes.  So while it's not as fast as a microwave, it still cooks very quickly and of course it will brown the food, which the microwave cannot do.<br /><br />I've reheated several food items and it did a great job there as well.  Amongst these items were several slices of the aforementioned leftover thin crust pizza slices after they had been stored in the fridge for a day.  Had I thrown them in the microwave, I'd have eaten pizza slices with a soggy crust.  Yuck.  But even after a day in the refrigerator, this oven crisped the crust just like it had been the day before when it arrived fresh out of the oven.<br /><br />The size of the oven is on the large side.  You need to have a decent amount of available real estate on your countertop, so if you are unsure that it will fit, get out your measuring tape just to be certain.  The size of the oven is roughly 18.5\\"" wide x 10.5\\"" high x 12.5\\"" inches deep excluding the handle.  Including the door's handle, the oven would be about 14.5\\"" deep.  The obvious upside to the large size is that you have quite a bit of cooking space inside, so this item is more of an oven than a toaster where I think that most competing products are just the opposite.<br /><br />The display is bright and I found it to be easy to read.  However, I wouldn't have minded if they had included a clock, which would have been a simple and inexpensive feature to add.  I would have also liked to see an interior light.  While the magnets do pull the rack out halfway when the door is opened, that feature only works when the rack is in the middle position.  Perhaps in the future, they could extend the vertical reach of the magnets so that the feature will extend the rack irrespective of the rack's position within the oven.<br /><br />It's true that the oven does get somewhat hot, but I suppose one should expect that.  However, it's not hot beyond reason and certainly throws off far less heat than a conventional oven.  Preheating is a fast process and the oven reaches the desired temperature quickly.  A button is provided to convert the displayed temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius.  This is a feature that won't be used often, but could come in handy when converting recipes.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is a slam dunk 5 star product.  I wouldn't even think to give it a lower rating for one moment.  It's actually one of the best looking, best designed and best performing products of any type that I can recall using in quite some time.  Breville definitely put a lot of thought, research and engineering into this one.  I strongly recommend this product.est looking, best designed and best performing products of any type that I can recall using in quite some time.

When 10 minutes remain, it begins to count down the seconds also.  On completion of the cooking cycle, three pleasant-sounding beeps are heard.

This oven runs extremely quiet, and everything I've prepared so far using the toasting, baking, roasting, and broiling functions has come out with perfect results using the default settings.  You have a choice of 9 functions, as well as conventional, convection, fresh, or frozen selections.<br /><br />This Breville countertop oven is of outstanding quality and comes with three accessories, an enamel baking, broiling, and 13\\"" pizza pan.  One feature that is not included and would add to the functionality and convenience is an interior light. I feel that considering the quality and price of this oven, one should definitely be included.  Then, it would be absolutely perfect!  For the absence of the light, it gets 4 stars instead of 5.  Even so, I highly recommend this appliance, for it is truly a \\""smart oven\\"".<br /><br />  UPDATE AFTER A YEAR OF USE:  I began using this oven in December of 2008, and here in December of 2009, I still love this oven.  It has performed well over the past year, and I hardly ever use my big oven any more.  I use it for almost everything.  No problems after a year of use, and it still is the most stylish appliance in my kitchen.  Still wish an interior light had been included, as this is the ONLY drawback I've seen to this oven.

It also comes with a 13-inch round pizza pan and a 12 x 12 broiling dish, along with the standard rack. An insert that came in the box also mentioned that you can order various other inserts for the oven, such as a pizza stone, if you'd like even more options in cooking and baking.<br /><br />The oven also contains three slots to position the rack, depending on what you are making.  This is a really nice feature since it allows you to make sure that your food is evenly cooked and properly positioned next to the heating elements.<br /><br />The digital control module on this is also fantastic.  I honestly get a bit worried when appliances begin to look too complicated and I have to read the instruction manual, but the controls on this are very intuitive and user-friendly, and, for the basic cooking features I've used it for so far, I have only had to take a quick peek at the starter's manual, although eventually I will  get out the larger Instruction Manual (which includes some recipes) to try out more of the features on this.<br /><br />The oven has nine settings for things like toast, bagels, frozen pizzas, cookies, etc. that are pre-programmed, but you also have the option of entering your own information to customize how you would like something cooked.  When you are using the oven, the control module lights up in a blue color, but, once you are finished cooking, the blue light shuts off after ten minutes (which was a relief for me since I didn't want to have to see a blue light on in my kitchen all the time).<br /><br />As with any new toaster oven, it does take a little bit of playing with the settings to find those that fit how you like your food.  For instance, I used the \\""middle\\"" toast setting when making my frozen waffles this morning (which is the setting I've been using on our old toaster oven), and it made the waffles a bit too brown for my tastes. As mentioned, though, that just will take a bit of trial and error.  Overall, the cooking and toasting aspects of this are great, and the food that I have made it in so far has turned out to be evenly cooked and great, due to the fantastic heating elements.<br /><br />Someone mentioned in a previous review that the cord is a bit short, but it's not any shorter than cords on other toaster ovens or small kitchen appliances we've owned in the past.  In fact, the attention to detail is so fantastic on this Breville oven that there is even a finger hole in the large, thick plug that makes pulling it from the wall very easy.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely a five-star product!<br /><br />Edit on 12/31/08:  I wanted to update my review to say that I baked a batch of muffins in this yesterday, and they came out great.  This oven is big enough to hold my regular-sized 12-muffin baking tin (which our old toaster oven couldn't do), and the muffins themselves came out light and fluffy.find those that fit how you like your food.

It's about the size of a microwave but does many things microwaves won't do.  This convection oven is easy to use and makes cooking a breeze.  Convection means it has a fan to circulate the hot air inside the oven, thus heating the food faster and more evenly.<br /><br />Made of stainless steel, it has a high-quality feel as soon as you open the well-designed box it's packed in.  The oven has nice rubber feet to keep it from sliding and even bumpers on the back to keep it out from the wall a few inches.  The LCD display is bright and easy to read, blue backlighting with black letters.  The rack has three different positions, in the middle position it ejects automatically when you open the door.  Also comes with a pizza pan and baking pan.<br /><br />Cooking is easy, one knob controls the function (Toast , Bagel, Bake, Roast, Broil, Pizza, Cookies, Reheat, and Warm), one knob controls the temperature, and the other controls time.  In no time I was reheating pizza (Reheat, 15 minutes at 325 degrees) and making pork chops (35 minutes at 350 degrees.)  It heats up much faster than a large oven.<br /><br />About the only complaint is that the top of course gets very hot while/after the oven has been used, and it's somewhat easy to accidentally let your hand touch the oven when you grab the handle.<br /><br />Edit 09/2012:  I've used this for years for everything from toast to pizza to fish.  Anything I reheat that I want crispy like french fries goes in here.  I'm sure it uses less electricity than my full-size oven.  Still looks new other than me needing to clean it.  ;)",2008-12-24

I bought a Cuisinart Convection Toaster Oven Broiler a few months ago when Amazon had is on sale as a Gold Box Deal one day. So, for that price of about $110 on sale, it does the job. HOWEVER, once I received this new Breville Oven today, I am sorry I have to change my loyalty to it. It does all the same things as the Cuisinart I bought but better and also does more things! I can make 6 slices of toast in it with room to spare (with a .9 CU-ft interior instead of a .5 like my other one has), and it also doesn't seem to take so long to toast as the other one did. I think the pre-set program is great even though I so far have only tried it on Pizza. It cooks it like a brick oven with the crust crispy, the bottom dough cooked perfectly and the cheese on top just right instead of burning it as the regular toaster ovens do. The overall heat makes it hotter where it needs to be. I also love the fact that the rack placement shows on the front of the glass door so you know where to place it and it slides in easily without a lot of maneuvering. Probably for someone clumsy in the kitchen like me, the best part is that the wire rack ejects itself almost half way and so you don't have to burn yourself to get your food out. I think this is a great oven, well worth the price, and one that would save on energy as you wouldn't need to heat your big oven for I say 90% of your cooking...and that includes baking. This Smart Oven even comes with a 13 inch non-stick pizza pan and a 12 x 12-inch baking pan and rack. I have to give it 5 stars...and now wonder who wants my still like new Cuisinart.<br /><br />Submitted by Karen Haney for Amazon Vine, December, 2008",2008-12-23

It's about twice the size of my cheapo Black & Decker toaster oven.  On the other hand, it's quite a bit smaller than my Electrolux convection double oven, and has pretty much the same features.  From a size perspective I struggle with whether to keep this or not because of the counter space it will occupy.  It's really too big to stow away like I currently do with my old toaster oven.<br /><br />At $249 this oven is significantly more expensive than the other ones out there.  In my current situation I would not pay that much money for an oven like this because I feel like I can get close to the same thing with my double oven, which has a lower oven that is for smaller jobs.  In my last house which had a regular crappy GE oven with no convection, this oven would have been a lifesaver because it has the convection, a lot of neat features, and can cook almost everything except for a large meal.<br /><br />I tested this oven on the \\""Toast\\"" mode, and it works perfectly.  It allows you to choose from 1-6 slices, and adjusts the time accordingly.  In fact, it also adjusts the time if the oven is cold, or if it's still warm from recent use.  On a \\""cold start\\"", one slice takes 4 minutes, and 6 slices take about 5 minutes.  The oven allows you to choose from light to dark.  I feel like if I keep this oven I can eliminate my toaster, which will help.<br /><br />I also tested this oven baking some corn dogs and pigs-in-a-blanket for the kids, and it worked very well.  You can set it to \\""Bake\\"", select your temperature and length of time, hit start, and it preheats the oven, then lets you know when its ready.  It will then start counting down the time as soon as the oven is hot.  It beeps to let you know it's done.<br /><br />I have not cooked a pizza yet, but I looked at the program and it looks like you select \\""Pizza\\"", put your frozen pizza on the provided no stick pizza pan, slide it in, hit the \\""frozen\\"" button (looks like a snow flake), choose the size of the pizza (13\\"" or smaller), and then hit start.  Babysitter proof pizza cooking....I like this a lot.<br /><br />The controls on this oven are very intuitive.  I have yet to crack the owner's manual, and don't feel like I need to.<br /><br />I like the blue control screen...very easy to read, and looks very high tech.<br /><br />The oven gets hot on the outside (duh!) everywhere except the control pad and door handle, so be careful where you touch it.  The oven has nice big rubber no-slip feet that keep the oven elevated about 1\\"" above your counter top.  So don't be afraid of it possibly damaging your counter if your surface is susceptible to heat damage.<br /><br />The glass door has indicators printed on the front that tell you which of the 3 rack settings to use for a given purpose.  They are as follows: Top Rack = Broil, Middle Rack = Toast, Cookie, Bagel, Pizza, Bottom Rack = Bake, Roast, Reheat, Warm.  I think this is a cool feature.<br /><br />The oven has 4 burner elements...twice as many as my smaller toaster oven.  I think this oven has the power and room inside to roast a whole chicken.<br /><br />The rack automatically slides out when you open the door, and when you close the door it pushes the rack back inside the oven without you having to touch it.  This is also a very cool feature.<br /><br />All of the components of this oven look and feel like they are built with a lot of quality.  I'm not that familiar with Breville as a manufacturer, but I am impressed by this oven.  The stainless steel finish is of a quality tht matches my professional grade appliances.<br /><br />In summary, if you have the counter space and a normal featureless oven, this is a great oven to have.

It is a heavy, quality appliance, with numerous handy, smart features. I just got it today, and I will update my review later if needed.  I cooked some *perfect* cupcakes in it a little while ago, so I'm going on that experience.<br /><br />1. The instruction book (with about 30 recipes & ideas) is very easy to understand and follow.  We had it up and going in minutes, doing the initial heating for 15 minutes to rid the heating elements of a protective coating.  There was some odor (no smoke) with this process, but not that bad, and I just opened a window slightly.  After this, there was no smell at all when I cooked.<br /><br />2. The oven door has magnetized areas that pull the oven rack about half way out when you open the door.  It's a great concept, and guess what? -- it works!  Makes it so handy to get your food out without reaching in and risking a burn.<br /><br />3. The interior has .8 cubic feet of space.  A 12&#34; x 12&#34; enamel baking pan, with broil rack, and a 13&#34; non-stick pizza pan are included, and fit snugly inside -- a pan any bigger wouldn't fit.  I made 12 cupcakes at a time on the pizza pan (using silicone muffin cups) and had plenty of room.  (The pizza pan didn't buckle or warp, so it's obviously a sturdy piece.)  My 1/4 sheet pan and several other pieces I have fit nicely inside, which I'm so pleased about.  This thing fits 6 pieces of toast! (I want to mention that they don't advise using glass baking dishes in the oven. I'm scared of breakage that I've read about, so I don't use glass anymore anyway.)<br /><br />3. The glass door has markings on it to tell you which position to put the rack in (bottom, middle or top), depending on what you're cooking.<br /><br />4. The LCD display is very easy to read (esp for someone who needs reading glasses like me).  The temperature, function, and time controls are knobs -- similar to stereo control knobs -- and I like that you don't have to keep incessantly punching a button to go up or down; you simply twist to get where you want, and you can go slowly or quickly. Also, there are a minimum of icons (there are 3 buttons for frozen food, convection, & temperature conversion) on the controls -- most functions are spelled out so that you don't have to use a &#34;cheat sheet&#34; to figure out what picture stands for what!<br /><br />5. The convection feature is very quiet with this oven and you can barely hear it.  Some settings such as &#34;bake&#34; are programmed to switch on the convection feature, which keeps down the need to fiddle with several controls to get what you want.  I made cupcakes today on bake, and they were done a full 3-4 minutes quicker.<br /><br />6. The large door handle is easy to grab and open, and stays cool to the touch.<br /><br />7. The top of the oven gets hot during cooking, so you can keep food warm on a ceramic plate(s) on top while other food cooks.  There is also a &#34;cutting board and tray&#34; that can be used on the top but I was unable to find it on Breville's website so I will call them later. (You can also get a pizza stone and pizza crisper.)<br /><br />8. The crumb tray fits snugly into the front of the unit, and not in the back like other toaster ovens I've had, so removal and cleaning is easy.<br /><br />The only suggestion that I would have is that a small interior light would be helpful.<br /><br />As I have always liked about toaster ovens, you don't have to heat up your large oven to bake or cook a meal.  And I don't think most of us have convection ranges, so having this feature on a toaster oven is great.  I really do have to give this oven 5 stars because it is designed so incredibly well.  I may never use my stove again -- except for a full-sized turkey!<br /><br />UPDATE 12-27-2008:  I received an email back from Breville, and they say the accessories for this oven (see#7 above) will be available April 2009.  I have been using my Breville daily for a little over a week now, and I can see myself years from now doing the same.  Still extremely impressed with this work horse!<br /><br />UPDATE 3-29-09:  According to the Breville website, a pizza stone and a pizza crisper for the Breville Smart Oven will be available for sale 5-9-09.  The cutting board and tray that fit on top of the oven has a &#34;TBA&#34; availability date. And I am still considering this toaster oven one of the best I've ever come across!<br /><br />UPDATE 6-08-09:  *Another* delay from Breville for the cutting board/tray and the pizza stone -- those will be available at the BrevilleUSA website (and here at Amazon, I suppose) this month (June 2009), unless they change the date once again.  A pizza crisper will be available in July 2009.  I continue to use my SmartOven daily, and it has a prominent place in my kitchen.<br /><br />UPDATE 12-21-09:  Looks like all the accessories mentioned are now available at the Breville site.  Hope they are soon available on Amazon and available with Prime shipping!<br /><br />UPDATE: 5-23-10:  I see that the accessories for this oven are now available on Amazon.  I must say that the prices seem outrageous, and similar accessories at lower prices are made by other manufacturers, which I would explore if I needed/wanted them.  I have the Petite Broil and Roast pan by Chicago Metallic (one of my favorite brands of bakeware) and it works wonderfully in this oven.  C.M. also makes a whole toaster oven set, including a muffin tin.<br /><br />It's 1 1/2 years later, and I still use my Breville almost every day -- still love it and not one hint of problems.  Crumb tray in the front is SO very easy to pull out and to keep clean.<br /><br />UPDATE:  We are still going strong!  Because it is a toaster and a baker and a roaster and more,  I use it almost everyday.  Don't know if Breville ever worked on the interior light thing,  but if installed somewhere at eye level with good lighting (which I don't) ,  wouldn't be an issue.DATE 3-29-09:  According to the Breville website, a pizza stone and a pizza crisper for the Breville Smart Oven will be available for sale 5-9-09.

Cakes need to be cooked thru out which is different than pizza which needs a crispy crust but not burnt cheese.<br /><br />The auto programs all seem to be well tested and perform wonderfully. Even chicken and meats cook thru. Frozen items also cook well. It seems a great deal of time testing this unit was done before releasing it for sale. Even re-heating foods works well.
