      "I'll keep this short and sweet.  As far as functionality goes, I love this microwave.  It heats things much faster than my old Panasonic, and the inverter defrost technology is great.  Things are still slightly cold in the center if you're defrosting something large, but it heats much more evenly than any other microwave I've seen.  That was the main selling point for me.    Now I'll get down to my main gripe, which is the display.  For some reason, Panasonic decided that the display should be more readable while looking UP at the microwave!  As in they expect us to put this on our refrigerators or some other platform.  I took two pics to show what I'm talking about.  This is the first one, looking at the microwave's display from 1 foot above (which I would consider the average viewing angle for a table-top microwave):  [...].  This is what you will see when you apparoach this microwave.  All you SHOULD be able to see is 1:12.    Now, this is a pic of the display looking at it from 1 foot BELOW the microwave:  [...].  As you can see, looking at it from below, the display is perfect.    WHY Panasonic?  Why did you design the display upsidesown?  What were you thinking?  It's not a deal breaker since I still like the microwave, but it is such a stupid mistake that I can hardly believe it.  I have never seen a home with a microwave of this sort that is above eye level.  Yet, the display was designed to be viewed above eye level.     Other than that, I have no complaints so far.  But they really should think about correcting this for future models.  I would be embarrassed if I were responsible for something like this.\n",

      "In March 1985, I purchased a 1.4 cu/ft Panasonic microwave oven, the specific statistics for which I do not recall off-hand.  I don't see that particular size advertised amy more.  It has the carousel, but it doesn't have all the other bells and whistles that are advertised now, though it has enough of its own.  In particular, it does not have a popcorn setting, which I think is the reason that the only thing that does not come out well is popcorn.  It just does not work well for that - never has.  BUT, it has been nothing but an OUTSTANDING performer all these years for everything else.  AND, we have never had to have it repaired.  Like the Energizer Bunny, it just keeps going, and going, and..... .  I am looking at a new unit now ONLY BECAUSE I don't know if the one we have is performing up to par, or whether it is still perfectly safe after all these years of usage.  When I replace it, it will be with another Panasonic of about the same size.  I am debating only whether to get the 1 1/5 cu/ft model, or the 1.6.      The reason I am writing this review is in case some of you might be in doubt as to which microwave to purchase.  If our experience means anything to you doubters, then your decision should be an easy one now.  OVER TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF PERFECT SERVICE IS HARD TO BEAT!\n",

      "I was excited to upgrade to a larger microwave as my old one was a small 1cuft one. When it worked, I loved it but sometimes it would just stop. I would turn it on and after about 20 seconds I would notice it was not on, there was no beep like it had finished early ...thought maybe the 'Genius' feature was picking up extra steam and assuming it was done, but it would say it was done if that were the case and it didn't. the screen would just be off. It wasn't tripping a breaker or anything of that such, it would just turn off. I would turn it back on and 20 seconds later it would be off again.<br />I ended up returning it and purchasing a different microwave altogether.\n",

I was hoping it would rotate a 9 X 13 pan but it doesn't. You can fit a 9 X 13 in it, but it is not large enough on the inside to rotate it. Since we couldn't even fit a 9 X 13 glass pan in the old Amana, this definitely fits the bill for my parents' needs. I am happy with it and hope they will be too.\n",

      "1. When the microwave is on, it blocks all WiFi in the whole house. 2. Microwave died after less than a year. It usually doesn't recognize the door as being closed, so it won't turn on. The problem's been getting worse over the past few months so it's now unusable. &#34;But there's a warranty, right?&#34;.. yes, if you want to spend your life trying to call unresponsive and unhelpful people, and jumping through their ridiculous hoops, maybe you can get some portion of your money back if you start within the first 12 months.<br /><br />Also, one reason I bought this model is the inverter. However, I now realize that the inverter is no better (from a cooking and heat transfer perspective) than the previous technology, which was to simply cycle the microwave on and off to control the rate of heating. And the inverter is probably the cause of the WiFi scrambling.\n",

      "We bought this microwave in 2008 and have been using it every day for the past six years.<br />This 1250 watt Panasonic microwave is terrific.  First off, it is very sleek to look at; we have ours caddy-cornered at a countertop bend and as appliances go, this black microwave looks attractive.  The buttons are neatly laid out on the panel, the interface is simple and the LED readout is a pleasant green.  It rests on four hard rubber feet in the corners which keep the microwave firmly planted and vibration free during operation.  The power output on this microwave is very high, it took some getting used to not overcook things.  Even now, we do not cook things for the entire recommended times food packages say as we have learned how to compensate for this microwaves higher power.  Plus, there is a power level function that allows you to cook at lower power settings if your cooking needs require.  The Invertor defrost is a good function that defrosts frozen foods fairly even as well.<br />Overall, this microwave was an excellent choice and has stood the test of time extremely well.  I do not hesitate to recommend it.  At the time we bought it, this microwave came recommended as a Consumer Reports top pick.<br />I comparison shop a lot before buying anything - hopefully you can benefit from my time investment and review.\n",

      "My microwave of 20 plus yrs. went so I needed a microwave in a hurry. Did some research online and decided on this Panasonic.  I do not use my microwave for making meals. I use it to reheat and defrost. It is much quicker than my old microwave so you need to adjust time and temps. The first microwave I received from Amazon was scratched and look refurbished, but I had purchased new. They sent me another one but did not upgrde the standard shipping.  The second one was fine. overall I am pleased with my microwave, it has lots of room, but does not take up a lot of space.\n",

      "My previous microwaves have all lasted at least 10 years. So I was very stunned to have this one die in less than 2 years. I have had previous Panasonic products that I loved and which have been very dependable. And I liked this one very much up to the day it died.  When I went on line to find a service center that I could take it to for warranty repairs of the magnetron tube, There was not anywhere I could take it without traveling over an hour and no one is open on a weekend, so it means taking a day off work to get it to the warranty center.  VERY disappointed in Panasonic this time.\n",

      "Just purchased a new 2.2 cuft, 1,250-watt unit.  This is the second 2.2 cuft, 1,250-watt unit of Panasonic's purchased in the last 4-5 years.  The first decided to just smoke rather than heat or cook requiring replacement.  When functional it heated and cooked to meet all expectations.  The new \\\\\"Sensor\\\\\" features leave a lot to be desired if you cover the food to reduce cleaning requirements.  This would not stop me from buying another unit or recommending them to others.<br /><br />However. . . If you are running wireless computers and equipment they are a total bust!  The old unit interfered with computer wireless router signals.  The new unit is, if anything, worse.  This has been uniform using three different brands of routers and 4 different laptop computers from 4 different brands ranging from $300 to $3,000 in new purchase cost.  All had problems when the microwave was in use and not at any other times.\n",

      "This was a replacement for an almost identical model which was over 11 years old and finally gave up.  Panasonic's reputation and our own experience with the brand are what drove us to the decision to get this one.  It works as expected.  If there's one issue, one that I've noticed in other reviews on this model, is the door latch.  When the door-release button is pressed, the door should at least &#34;pop-open&#34; to some extent.  Instead, we need to press the button and then pull the door outward in order to place an item in the oven, or to remove something from it.  In my mind, this is a simple design flaw that should have been addressed and I do fault Panasonic for not fixing it.  It's especially annoying when one has something in one hand to place in the oven.  Otherwise, the oven works satisfactorily.\n",

      "Complete garbage. Replaced a 25 year old microwave (wish I still had it) with this thing. It's interface is as esoteric as any other microwave (press sensor reheat 8 times to reheat veggies.... it can only show a few letter on the screen at a time, so it takes like 30 seconds to read everything if you press for each and wait for the scroll).<br /><br />The big issue is that the door has gradually gotten harder and harder to close. This seems to be a common problem with this model. I have to slam the door so hard that the entire microwave shifts position, and it makes a noise that likely wakes the neighbors. Sometimes it closes but doesn't register that it's closed, so you have to do it all again, but with more violence.<br /><br />Bottom line: it's a lemon, avoid it. And if anyone ever finds a modern microwave that DOESN'T suck, please tell me, because we need one.\n",

      "I have had this microwave since November of 2010 and I am extremely happy with it. Over the almost eight months since I bought it I have used only two buttons: Sensor Reheat and Start. In fact, the Sensor Reheat button is the only reason I bought it in the first place, and it's totally worth it! I can see why some people might think it tends to overcook some foods, but I think it just brings the food to the temperature it would be fresh out of the oven or pan, and I don't mind waiting a few minutes for the dish to cool down. If I were to complain about anything, it would be the gargantuous size, although its capacity is very impressive. But my kitchen is rather small, and the microwave does take up a lot of room. Its size does make it super easy to clean though!<br /><br />UPDATE 7/29/2013 - After almost three years this microwave is still going strong! No problems whatsoever. I know some reviews indicate a much shorter lifespan, which I remember made me weary back when I bought the microwave. However, I do not use my microwave on a daily basis - only maybe 3-4 times per week. I largely prefer other cooking methods.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/14/16 - Still using this microwave! Going on our sixth year together - longest relationship ever haha! Just kidding, I've loved my dog a lot longer ;)\n",

      "This and similar inverter models from Panasonic is an expensive piece of JUNK. I bought this model less than a year ago.  As if I did not learn from my experience with the same model that I bought earlier, but it was the 1200 watt model.  I liked the huge internal dimensions--I could put my bigger trays and even whole roasts to heat. The biggest complaint is the force I have to use when closing the door. It is hard to close without moving the unit. I have to slam hard on the door to make it close if I don't hold on to the back of the unit when closing the door so that the unit doesn't move.  After just a few months, the same with the last one I bought, the door sensor stopped working--and therefore the whole unit. I have learned my lesson, I will stay away from push button door models and from Panasonic in general. STAY AWAY from this so-called Genius model--it actually is an IDIOT model.\n",

      "We owned this microwave for 28 months when it stopped working (it would run for just a few seconds before turning off, while expelling a horrible smell of burned semiconductors). I pulled the cabinet off to investigate the problem (needed a torx security bit to do this) - if you attempt this, don't forget to unplug the microwave first.  I very cautiosly plugged the microwave back in (keeping my distance from the exposed electronics while wearing safety glasses), and started it... the inverter (p/n F606Y6G00CP) was smoking and melting part of it's plastic housing. I have opted to scrap the microwave versus trying to replace this $75+ part.      Before buying this microwave I would recommend googling \\\\\"panasonic inverter problem\\\\\". As far as I can tell, these Panasonic ovens have a chronic quality problem.  The science behind the inverter results in a lighter microwave oven, meaning cheaper to produce and ship.  My recommendation is to avoid this oven even though the feature set seems compelling, and reviewers (mostly who just bought the oven) are giving it high ratings.    On the plus size, we loved the large size and the high wattage rating - foods cooked quicker in this microwave than our previous 1000 watt oven.  We used the sensor cooking for 3.5 oz popcorn bags, and it worked fairly well, leaving only 20 or so old maids in the bag (however my advice is to follow the directions on the popcorn bag instead of using the sensor cooking - keep track of how many seconds are really needed, then just key that in for future bags).  Also, the turbo defrost did a decent job in defrosting hamburger evenly and quickly.    This microwave did disrupt our Wi-Fi (802.11g) network.  We frequently stream video wirelessly and the microwave would disrupt the signal, pausing the streaming.  The scarey thing is my wife and I could stand together in front of the microwave, blocking the disruption (one of us alone apparently doesn't offer enough resistance to whatever signals the microwaveis emitting).    As much as I liked this microwave, I would not buy another Panasonic with inverter technology.  I cannot give a product that has known reliability issues more than 2 stars (and am probably generous there).  I hope others who have bought this microwave have better luck than we had.\n",

Pushing the button would not fully disengage the door.  I now have to use two hands to open the door, one for pushing the button and the other for pulling on the door at the bottom.   The warranty doesn't cover this type of wear defect.  I called the manufacturer to get repair information.  They couldn't give me any information on making a repair.  They suggested that I take the Microwave to a local repair shop.  That type of repair would cost about the same as buying a new machine.  I was hoping to get a copy of a page in the repair manual so that I could do the work myself but the only thing they would do is sell me the repair manual for $50.  I'm very disappointed they couldn't help me with such a simple repair.  I would like to keep the microwave since it still works good, but I guess these machines are like toasters.
