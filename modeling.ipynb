We can put a plate or bowl of food in to reheat--we just have to hit the Sensor Reheat button and then Start. That's all! You do not have to keep opening and shutting the microwave to stir, etc. It is heated perfectly. To defrost foods we hit the Turbo Defrost button, then enter the weight. During the defrost feature it will ask you to turn your item over but that is all. It defrosts perfectly! No over heated or cooked edges! It is a miracle!! Over the years, we have ruined so many foods by incorrectly defrosting them--we cannot begin to count the $$s. You will not be disappointed if you purchase this microwave.\n",

      "First of all, this microwave is HUGE.  Like massive.  I think you could probably land a fighter plane inside the thing.  (Okay, it's not quite THAT large--but if your kitchen is counter-top limited, you are going to want to find something smaller.)<br /><br />That said, it's a 1250 watt microwave.  I love being able to take food directions and cut time off the instructions and have my food hot when I do it.  :)<br /><br />The thing is that some foods do not like being cooked quite that fast.  Hot Pockets (elsewhere claimed to be the most important microwave meal ever) do not cook at 1250 watts without splurting filling out of them.  Yes, splurting.  It's a word, I just made it up and I have a license to do that I made myself.  :)<br /><br />The major selling point of this microwave for me, aside from its very high power rating is the inverter technology.  Before you dismiss that as a gimmick, think of how microwaves operate when you reduce their power.  Notice that at 50% power, the microwave runs and then sounds like something extra turns on and off?  The thing you hear is actually the part of the microwave that cooks the food.  When you read that a microwave has 10 power levels, what they really mean that it has one power level (100%) that can be on as little as 1/10th the time your food is cooking.<br /><br />Well, Panasonic's inverter thing doesn't work that way.  When you set 50% power on this thing, your food is cooking at about 625 watts full-time.  Which means I can choose a power level (70% in this case) and the hot pockets actually cook and don't usually explode.<br /><br />I personally would recommend buying a Panasonic inverter-based microwave--in fact, I just did.  ...Maybe not THIS one, unless you want a microwave oven the size of your stove's oven.\n",

      "Just purchased a new 2.2 cuft, 1,250-watt unit.  This is the second 2.2 cuft, 1,250-watt unit of Panasonic's purchased in the last 4-5 years.  The first decided to just smoke rather than heat or cook requiring replacement.  When functional it heated and cooked to meet all expectations.  The new \\\\\"Sensor\\\\\" features leave a lot to be desired if you cover the food to reduce cleaning requirements.  This would not stop me from buying another unit or recommending them to others.<br /><br />However. . . If you are running wireless computers and equipment they are a total bust!  The old unit interfered with computer wireless router signals.  The new unit is, if anything, worse.  This has been uniform using three different brands of routers and 4 different laptop computers from 4 different brands ranging from $300 to $3,000 in new purchase cost.  All had problems when the microwave was in use and not at any other times.\n",

We had to go to the manual to find that we should seek out the nearest maintenance facility. Not sure why Panasonic offered up the code. \\\\\"Call Out for Pizza, Sucker!\\\\\" would have been more appropriate. No parts and no maintenance available. Nice job Panasonic.

      "This microwave has good features and power.  However, it leaks microwave radiation to such an extent that it disrupts our wireless (wifi) home network whenever it's running.<br />It replaced an old microwave, which we had used for well over a decade.  Shortly after we began using this new Panasonic, we realized that it disrupts our wireless connectivity whenever it is running.  This never happened with the old microwave, which had nearly the same power level, and which was located in the exactly the same spot.  In addition to this evidence, we also had a house inspector (for other purposes) who happened to have a device that clearly showed the radiation leakage.  I suppose that a certain level of leakage is allowed, but this one is clearly leaking at a much higher level than our old one.<br />Aside from the inconvenience of it, one worries whether this level is safe.  I would NEVER buy this model again (nor probably this brand, either).  We will probably be looking to replace this one, to reclaim some peace of mind.\n",

      "After a little over 1 year of light to moderate use, both safeties on the door started failing. It requires slamming the door and hitting it multiple times to get the safeties to engage. The problem appears design related. Internally the plastic levers that manipulate the micro-switch safeties are worn. The metal bracket holding the electronics assembly is soft metal that doesn't seem to hold its shape over time. The door has always required significant force to close (enough to slide it on the counter top) which, in my opinion, makes pre-mature wear much more likely.<br /><br />Other than the fact that it hasn't lasted well, I love this machine enough that I won't give up on it. It's very roomy and powerful. I will most likely continue to tweak the design until it stays functional.\n",

      "I own a b&b and cook all of my bacon in our microwave (try it, it's great and much cleaner than cook top frying and tastes even better). I use the microwave mostly for bacon, heating beverages, and defrosting items. It probably gets around 1 to 2 hours of use on the average day and maybe as much as 4 hours during our busy season.<br /><br />I've had it for several years and recently a friend was visiting and inadvertently snapped off the closure peg on his arm while closing the door. Up until that point the unit had been working great.<br /><br />I can fit a 9 x 13 Pyrex onto the carousel and it turns nicely. I particularly like the inverter turbo defrost function, which does a good job on everything except frozen sausage and hamburger (no matter what I do, these seem to always partially cook). It defrosts a 5 lb chunk of bacon perfectly and also defrosts bread, sauces and soups without cooking them.<br /><br />I can think of no higher product encomium than buying a second unit.\n",

      "Reading other reviews, I was a little unsure about this purchase. Lots of reviews mentioned the multiple/complicated options (the primary user in our home is not good with mechanical objects)as well as questions on reliability.  Well, we're delighted. The first thing I did was put the manual away --unread. Alot of microwave use is heat or reheat and I wanted to get comfortable with basic functions before adding all the timer,defrost and other \\\\\"complex\\\\\" options. We are slowly adding in various functions as we want to try them. I think we would have been frustrated and less happy if we had tried to master all or even some of the functions right away.   About two weeks after receiving the microwave, my husband annouced that it had \\\\\"died.\\\\\" Panic! He then went back and reopened-closed the door. Voila, fixed! Somewhere, he had pushed an extra button or not pushed a button... So, he cleared the panel,started again and it was fine. Just starting over seems to cure alot of problems (unplug-replug or start over works more often than anyone thinks)  So, to wrap up: a powerful, well-designed, machine that has more complex functions and stands up to hard frequent use and is only as complicated as you want it to be. I don't know if timed defrostwill hold up well but I don't need that every day. We're very pleased.\n",

I was used to the over the range units, which sometimes got in the way of cooking on the stove.  They also had limited space, but were convenient non-the-less.    This Panasonic is the first large capacity, free standing microwave we have used.  The information provided in the booklet is easy to read, and has some great recipes.  Plus there is the option of going on to the web site to view more recipes and get support if needed.  I did not give it a full 5 star rating as we have not yet had opportunity to explore all of the dynamics of this unit. From what I have experienced, it warms/cooks things evenly, and quicker than the over the stove units I have used.

      "Loved it, the best microwave I've ever had.<br /><br />However, as most, I was experiencing the dreaded door latch failure and was looking at Amazon to purchase a new/different model, thinking that a more expensive one might be better.<br /><br />I found out that it is indeed a design defect which affect ALL Panasonic models :-(<br /><br />The door latch mechanism with the microswitches is mounted onto flimsy, easily bent, very thin sheet metal tabs.<br /><br />After a while, these tabs will bend, and with them the entire door latch mechanism will move and be misaligned such that the hooks on the door will no longer activate the microswitches.<br /><br />Slamming the door might help for a while, but it actually contributes to more bending and more misalignment :-(<br /><br />Fortunately I found a fix on Youtube:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWVbHDMbl7Q<br /><br />It takes about five minutes to fix (probably temporarily, as the sheet metal tabs might eventually bend out of alignment again):<br /><br />1- remove the cover (five screws on back, two on side), need special screw bit<br /><br />2- remove the door latch mechanism (two screws)<br /><br />3- bend the flimsy sheet metal tabs toward the microwave cavity (i.e. inwards) in order to re-align the door latch mechanism<br /><br />4- reassemble.<br /><br />Note that I also added two wires to support the door latch mechanism, one ties the top of the latch to a hole on the top of the microwave cavity, and the other ties the bottom of the latch to one of the circular vent holes at the bottom of the microwave.<br /><br />Now that the latch mechanism is all tied up, hopefully the sheet metal tabs won't bend as easily as before, or at least will take longer to get out of alignment.<br /><br />Works like a charm (at least for now), and much better than throwing a perfectly good microwave to the dumpster.\n",

      "Great microwave, large interior without taking up too much counter space.  Heats at least twice as fast as my old one.  My only complaint is you cannot use the timer and cook something at the same time.  I used to use the timer to keep track of what I have on the stove or in the oven, while I heated up the veggies (or whatever) in the microwave.  I bought a small kitchen timer, so problem solved.  But it was a bit inconvenient, since I've had this feature on my previous 2 microwaves.\n",

      "I have always been partial to Panasonic microwaves and this is one of the best.  It has had constant daily use for over two months now with an excellent performance record.<br /><br />In fact, I have only used my stove and oven twice since this purchase (for a large frozen pizza).  The sensors are very accurate - oatmeal is perfect.  With two frozen dinners, I had to add additional time, but everything else has cooked, reheated or thawed as expected.<br /><br />Earlier reviews mentioned resetting the clock and a loud beep.  Panasonic must have listened to their customers as neither problem appears to be present on this model.<br /><br />With 1250 watts, it does reheat more quickly than older models so I would suggest reducing the time until you get used to your new microwave.<br /><br />UPDATE - 10/21/2008 - In December it will be two years - still perfect!\n",

      "Lasted 17 months before door interlock failed (turns off power).  YouTube shows repair but needs special tool and I was surprized at how flimsy the assembly appeared in the video.  The over-stiff latch always closed the door with a loud kathunk!  My previous Panasonic microwave was great and lasted 20 years of constant use and my many other products made by Panasonic had been excellent.  What a waste of money and a disappointment! Panasonic's past high quality approach seems to be absent in the Panasonic NN-H965BF Genius 2.2 cuft 1250 Watt microwave oven..\n",

      "I bought this model because I was tired of plates that were too large and popcorn bags that snagged when turning on the turntable in my little microwave. Now I could cook a 20-lb turkey if I wanted to! It has numerous handy programming functions, my favorite of which is the Sensor mode where it heats until it senses steam coming off the food and then turns off. Just make sure you have enough space for this large model.\n",
